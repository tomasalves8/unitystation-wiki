<p><strong>Role type</strong>: <font color= "#D4AF37">CentCom</font>. <strong>Access</strong>: <font color="green">Everything</font>. <strong>Difficulty</strong>: <font color="Red">Extreme</font>.</p>
<p>Note: ERT are not round-start roles and can only be accessed via events. The reasons for this should be clear by the end of the guide.</p>
<h2 id="ert-overall">ERT Overall<a class="headerlink" href="#ert-overall" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>So, the station is fucked, but not fucked enough to warrant a <a href="../Death-Squad/">death squad</a>? Is <a href="../../Command%20roles/Captain/">someone</a> in command simply incompetent? Has someone killed a <a href="../Central-Command-Officer/">Centcom Officer</a>? Well, its times like these that an ERT team may be sent, especially if one is requested using the communications console. The ERT officers are well armed and can adapt to fill a wide variety of roles, from fixing a reactor about to blow to spreading the word of the honk-mother.</p>
<h2 id="know-your-power-rangers">Know Your Power Rangers<a class="headerlink" href="#know-your-power-rangers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>ERT come in the following types. Commanders, who lead ERT teams, Security, who act as guards, Medical, who act as doctors, Engineers, who act more like emergency repairmen, and a variety of joke roles. Almost all ERT officers are armed with an energy carbine (or tactical variant) and a stun baton and all of them are equipped with heavily armored ERT hardsuits. You should expect any ERT squad members to be at least competent in their assigned role.</p>
<h3 id="ert-commander-leading-the-a-team">ERT Commander, Leading the A-team<a class="headerlink" href="#ert-commander-leading-the-a-team" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>ERT commanders are the most barebones squad member, equipped with nothing but their carbine, 2 batons, and a set of handcuffs. Their job, as the name implies, is to lead the ERT team on whatever objective they are given by <a href="Admin.md">Centcom</a>. To do this, they can make use of the unique Centcom channel to communicate plans, information, and orders to other members of the ERT team. If the chain of command is broken or <a href="../../../Guides/General%20guides/Battle-royale/">the station is in anarchy</a>, the commander of the response team may be forced to TEMPORARILY take charge in order to fill the power vacuum and allow a proper leader to be found peacefully.</p>
<h3 id="ert-security-diet-deathsquad">ERT Security, Diet Deathsquad<a class="headerlink" href="#ert-security-diet-deathsquad" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The ERT security officer acts as the spearpoint of any ERT team. They are armed with a tactical energy carbine, baton, taser, and two pairs of handcuffs, and sport a red and black hardsuit. They are typically sent  to apprehend <a href="Security.md">security</a> or <a href="../../Command%20roles/Head-of-Personnel/">heads</a> <a href="../../Engineering%20roles/Chief-Engineer/">of</a> <a href="../../Command%20roles/Captain/">staff</a> when the personnel onboard the station are unable or unwilling to do so. This typically is not a peaceful affair, and security ERT tend to kill more often then they apprehend, which is why they are often confused for being a <a href="../Death-Squad/">death squad</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ert-medic-walking-medkits">ERT Medic, Walking Medkits<a class="headerlink" href="#ert-medic-walking-medkits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The ERT medical officers are deployed to handle large scale medical emergencies, but sometimes are deployed not to save the crew, but to heal the ERT squad should they face especially heavy resistance. They wear a white marked hardsuit and are equipped with first aid kit and a medibelt. </p>
<h3 id="ert-engineers-the-only-competent-engineers">ERT Engineers, The Only Competent Engineers<a class="headerlink" href="#ert-engineers-the-only-competent-engineers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>ERT engineers are only typically sent when something onboard the station has, or is about to, blow up horribly. Their job is to fix the damage to the station or prevent further damage, and in this they act more like emergency repairmen than engineers. They are the type of ERT that will most often split from the squad, simply because while the other ERT are sent to deal with people, the engineer is sent to deal with walls and reactors, both of which tend not to have legs. Along with the usual gun and baton, they come with a tool belt, industrial welding tool, and a first aid kit.</p>
<h3 id="paranormal-response-team-spanish-ghostbusters">Paranormal Response Team, Spanish Ghostbusters<a class="headerlink" href="#paranormal-response-team-spanish-ghostbusters" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Technically a separate team, the PRT's purpose is to respond to and handle paranormal and cultish threats to the station. PRTs are similarly equipped to ERTs, apart from their custom magically fortified hardsuits, and come in 2 varieties; the inquisitor and the knight. Besides the armor, and the standard carbine, cuffs, and baton, the only unique item the inquisitor carries is the obsidian rod, just like the like the <a href="../../Service%20roles/Chaplain/">chaplain's</a>.</p>
<h3 id="joke-ert">Joke ERT<a class="headerlink" href="#joke-ert" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>There are also two types of joke ERT:</p>
<p>Janitor ERT, sent to purify and cleanse the station of filth and grime. The Janitor comes with an advanced mop, an empty bucket, a box of lightbulbs, stun baton, trash bag of holding, belt full of space cleaner spray bottles, back up mop, one'' wet floor sign and notably <strong>no</strong> energy carbine.</p>
<p>Clown ERT, sent to bring joy and annoyance to the crew. The clown ERT does come with an energy carbine (ooph), as well as baton, cuffs, a bike horn, and a banana.</p>
