UnityStation is a free to play game made as a clone to the Space Station 13 game, but built on Unity, instead of using the outdated BYOND . Space Station 13, the greatest spessmen simulator ever created. If you have ever played SS13 before you can agree on one thing, BYOND , it sucks! This is where UnityStation comes in. Started in Nov 2016 we have endeavored to ensure SS13 has a long and prosperous future outside of BYOND by cloning the /TG/ source to Unity. A lot of work has been completed since its humble beginnings in 2016 and we have just released our first public alpha release on our version of the BYOND hub called the Station Hub. The project has a growing and dedicated community of contributors who are eager to see this thing become a reality. Best of all it is all open source and available on GitHub. Probably Doobly , 2018. In this game, you pick from a variety of roles on different maps to keep the station running: Or you can try attacking it and maybe nuking it to ashes : Traitor, Changeling, Wizard, Cultist, NukeOps, Blob, Alien, Spider You can also become various difference races although some may be disabled on certain servers and some to be added: , , , , , , , , , , The game itself is a chaos machine, some times rounds can take 2 minutes. Usually if the wizard suicides into security. Otherwise it can be a 30 minute long Royale and others it can be a multiple hour long phoenix wright court simulator or even cult wasteland as the chaplain holds the line against the onslaught. It depends partly on what the server it is and what random thing happens. This wiki is still incomplete and can always use edits, you should add to it! We would like to thank all the devs who took their time in order to make unitystation a thing , if you want to support us consider donating to the cause.","title":"Home"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Construction/","text":"Construction \u00b6 Construction and deconstruction are essential tools for Engineers and Traitors alike, it is, however, decently intuitive.

Because of this you should be familiar with engineering BEFORE touching it, unless, of course, you intend to make the engine fail from the getgo. Overview \u00b6 The singularity and the tesla are very similar to eachother, to the extent that a single guide can comfortably cover both. While they differ in some aspects, such as power generation, they can generally be treated the same way. This guide will cover the specifics of both, how to start them, and how to run them. Background \u00b6 It is important to know just how the singularity and tesla reactors work before setting them up. The particle accelerator \u00b6 The particle accelerator, commonly reffered to as the \"PA\" is a multi-part machine that draws a large amount of power in order to create streams of high energy (damaging) particles. a particle accelerator forms a T shape, with the upper part of the \"T\" made from the 3 emitter sections. A console is attached to one side of the particle accelerator, from where it is controlled. In the console, the particle accelerator can be turned on or off, and its power level can be changed. Higher power levels will result in greater growth of the singularity and tesla, possibly to a dangerous extent. Each power level will take an increasing amount of power being fed into the PA to be sustained or activated. The particles emitted by the PA are able to pass through shields (but not the shield emitters!), and upon repetedly hitting the singularity and tesla generators will cause them to form a singularity or tesla ball. They will also \"feed\" both the singularity and tesla once they are generated. Although some Station start with one, a PA can be bought by cargo if needed. The shield generators (and emitters) \u00b6 The shield generators serve to keep the very dangerous objects inside them contained. To do this, they must first be wrenched down. The shield generators DO NOT recieve power from wires, and must instead be powered by being shot at by an emitter. Emitters periodically shoot a green beam in a straight line, which deals high damage if it hits a player. Keep in mind that any machines (i.e. radiation collectors) in between an emitter and a generator will be hit by the beam and eventually destroyed. Once a shield generator is charged, it can be turned on by hand, at which point it will spread its shields and (to an extent) its power among the other shield emitters. The general shield generator setup, which works for both the singularity and tesla is a 5x5 square, with the generators in the corners, a space of three empty tiles between them. Keep in mind, that having too many shields and not enough emitters may mean that the shields drain power faster than the emitters can supply, and will lead to the shields eventually failing. Singularity and singularity specific machines \u00b6 The singularity will destroy objects and players/mobs that fall into it, and will suck loose items, people, and creatures towards it. Touching the singularity is a guaranteed death sentence, and a loose singularity is often enough reason to call the shuttle. The singularity will wander around, even when contained, but cannot destroy or pass shields generated by shield generators unless sufficiently large. The singularity can grow by absorbing mass (ie: you and the rest of the station), which can be provided with some safety using the particle accelerator. The singularity will slowly decline in mass, converting it into radiation, but the rate of mass conversion is low enough that a loose singularity will generally not \"starve\". Radiation collectors are how you get power from the singularity. They will convert the radiation the singularity produces into electricity, which can be used in turn to power the station. You will want to place these as close as you can to the shield field, but not between the shield generators or within the bound of the singularitys containment zone. Then, wire them back into the station. After being placed and secured, the radiation collectors can then be deployed by being clicked. They will only function in their deployed state. Funnily enough, there is no distinction in the raditaion produced by a singularity and a nuclear reactor, so these can also be used aboard stations without a singularity to enhance power output. To create the singularity itself, you will need a singularity generator. The singularity generator should be placed in the center of the shield square, where it can be hit by a PA. It does not need to be wired to anything. When shot with the PA repetedly (prefferably after the shield generators are on), it will create a stage one singularity, which takes up a single tile. Due to the nature of the singularity, the generator is destroyed in the process. The singularity can then grow more and more as it is fed. A stage two singularity will generate more power, and take up 4 tiles, but require more mass to sustain itself (this trend of later stages converting mass faster continues) It can provide power to most stations without much difficulty. The largest stations may require a stage 3 singularity. While containable in the same way as the earlier stages, it takes up 9 tiles. It requires a large amount of incoming mass to sustain itself, but be careful to not over-feed it, as it becomes far more difficult to contain later stages. Stage 4 and 5 singularities will tear apart walls and ordinary machinery, even through shield generators. While a stage 4 singularity can be THEORETICALLY contained (does not rip out shield generators), a stage 5 singularity will flat out consume anything containing it, and is gaurenteed to get loose. Generally, you will only see a stage 4 and 5 singularity when a singularity has already broken loose and ate enough of the station to grow to such a size. There is a fifth type of singularity, a supermatter singularity, which can only occur if a singularity eats a supermatter crystal. it takes up an enormous area, has a massive pull, and you are generally screwed if one happens to exist. Dont bother trying to contain it, it will set you on fire and turn you into an atom-thin noodle. Tesla and tesla specific machines \u00b6 In comparison to the singularity, the Tesla has both numerous upsides and downsides. Like the singularity, the core of the tesla will wander aimlessly. It will emit periodic electric arc blasts. The strengh (and power generation) of these blasts is proportionate to the number of orbs orbiting the tesla itself. Upon reaching a machine or player, the arcs will do enormous damage or explode the machine (oftentimes with enough power to cause breaches). The damage from being hit by an arc is oftentimes enough to instantly kill a player, and insulated gloves will not save you. These arcs make the tesla far more dangerous when it is loose than a singularity. Unlike the singularity however, once the tesla has been set up it does not require babysitting and is easy to contain. The tesla cannot break the machinery around itself from within if the machinery is set up correctly, even if the tesla is at its maximum size. The teslas arcs will prioratize hitting grounding rods and tesla coils over everything else. Grounding rods serve to stop the arcs from damaging the coils or shield generators, and the coils convert the arcs into power. A tesla coil or a shield generator hit by an arc without any grounding WILL be damaged, which can cause the containment to fail if set up incorrectly. The tesla and the singularity are generated through near identical means, though the tesla instead uses the \"tesla generator\". Hit the tesla generator and the tesla it creates with PA blasts to create the tesla core and grow orbs around it. Unlike the singularity however, the tesla does not break loose when it is too large, so feel free to hit the PA to the maximum and leave it on. Setting up the generators \u00b6 0: In both cases you will want to find a 5x5 (or larger) empty region, along with space for the emitters, wiring, and the PA. Gather the appropriate material, which is the PA parts, wires, machines specific to the generator you want to create, shield generators, and emitters. The region should also have good access to the stations power grid. 1: Place the shield generators in the corners of the 5x5 (or larger) square. there should be a space of 3 tiles between them if you are using a 5x5 region. Wrench the generators down. The generators do not have to be wired to anything. 2: Place emitters facing the generators. Typically, a one tile gap is left, but this is optional. The emitters should be wired to the stations power grid or otherwise supplied with power. As emitters are dangerous and consume large amounts of power, dont turn these on yet. Remember to wrench them down one they are facing the proper direction and then weld them to the ground. 3: Move your chosen type of generator (singularity or tesla) into the very center of the construct. It should be equidistant to all of the shield generators where it can be easily hit by the PA. Wrench or weld it down if possible. 4: Build the PA. The similar looking rectangular regions with what look like red coils ontop of them should form the top of a T shape (if you aim your PA up). They are labelled as to which side they should be placed on. These, and all other parts, should be wrenched down when they are placed. Directly behind them, set up the part that looks like an exposed coil or magnet tube. The red part of it should face the regions you just placed. Behind this, set up the console interfacing part. It is rather clearly asymmetrical. If the PA is facing up, the flat region should face the right. In the adjacent region to the flat part, you should place the console itself And, to cap it all off, use the part which looks bulletlike. Wire the console or any part of the PA to a power source. The PA demands very large amounts of power, so a plasma generator, the station grid, or existing reactor is reccomended. Test fire the PA (FOR ONE BLAST!) at the construct to see if it works. There should be nothing in the path of the PA. Floors and glass are fine, as are tables, but grilles, emitters, shield generators, and walls will block the particles. Notably, the energy barrier put up by shield generators will not block the particles. 4.5 A: If you are making a singularity: place radiation collectors along the outside of where the shield field will be generated. wrench them down. they should not block the PA particle's paths. Deploy them by clicking them. Wire them to a transformer and other electrical converters 4.5 B: If you are making a tesla: Place one tesla coil at each side of the construct except for the one facing the PA. At the same time, place one or two grounding rods on each side. Wire the tesla coils to a transformer or other electrical devices and be sure that they are wrenched in place. 5: Turn on the emitters. If they were set up correctly this should be as simple as clicking on them. otherwise, check that they are secured and powered. 6: Wait for the emitters to power the shield generators. This is represented by a bar on the shield generator that will slowly fill up with a light blue color as the generator gets more power 7: When the generators are full, turn them on. This will create the shield field. 8: Return to the PA and turn it on. This will create a contained singularity or tesla which will begin creating power. Be sure to keep it fed, but not too large. If your tesla coils or radiation collectors were properly wired to the station (see guide to electricity ), you will be providing power.","title":"Guide to the singularity and tesla engines"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide%20to%20the%20Singularity%20and%20Tesla/#guide-to-the-singularity-and-tesla-engines","text":"Note: while both the singularity and the tesla are simpler than the nuclear reactor , the cost for failure is much higher.

The particles emitted by the PA are able to pass through shields (but not the shield emitters!), and upon repetedly hitting the singularity and tesla generators will cause them to form a singularity or tesla ball. They will also \"feed\" both the singularity and tesla once they are generated. Although some Station start with one, a PA can be bought by cargo if needed.","title":"The particle accelerator"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide%20to%20the%20Singularity%20and%20Tesla/#the-shield-generators-and-emitters","text":"The shield generators serve to keep the very dangerous objects inside them contained. To do this, they must first be wrenched down. The shield generators DO NOT recieve power from wires, and must instead be powered by being shot at by an emitter. Emitters periodically shoot a green beam in a straight line, which deals high damage if it hits a player. Keep in mind that any machines (i.e. radiation collectors) in between an emitter and a generator will be hit by the beam and eventually destroyed. Once a shield generator is charged, it can be turned on by hand, at which point it will spread its shields and (to an extent) its power among the other shield emitters. The general shield generator setup, which works for both the singularity and tesla is a 5x5 square, with the generators in the corners, a space of three empty tiles between them. Keep in mind, that having too many shields and not enough emitters may mean that the shields drain power faster than the emitters can supply, and will lead to the shields eventually failing.","title":"The shield generators (and emitters)"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide%20to%20the%20Singularity%20and%20Tesla/#singularity-and-singularity-specific-machines","text":"The singularity will destroy objects and players/mobs that fall into it, and will suck loose items, people, and creatures towards it. Touching the singularity is a guaranteed death sentence, and a loose singularity is often enough reason to call the shuttle. The singularity will wander around, even when contained, but cannot destroy or pass shields generated by shield generators unless sufficiently large. The singularity can grow by absorbing mass (ie: you and the rest of the station), which can be provided with some safety using the particle accelerator. The singularity will slowly decline in mass, converting it into radiation, but the rate of mass conversion is low enough that a loose singularity will generally not \"starve\". Radiation collectors are how you get power from the singularity. They will convert the radiation the singularity produces into electricity, which can be used in turn to power the station. You will want to place these as close as you can to the shield field, but not between the shield generators or within the bound of the singularitys containment zone. Then, wire them back into the station. After being placed and secured, the radiation collectors can then be deployed by being clicked. They will only function in their deployed state. Funnily enough, there is no distinction in the raditaion produced by a singularity and a nuclear reactor, so these can also be used aboard stations without a singularity to enhance power output. To create the singularity itself, you will need a singularity generator. The singularity generator should be placed in the center of the shield square, where it can be hit by a PA. It does not need to be wired to anything. When shot with the PA repetedly (prefferably after the shield generators are on), it will create a stage one singularity, which takes up a single tile. Due to the nature of the singularity, the generator is destroyed in the process. The singularity can then grow more and more as it is fed. A stage two singularity will generate more power, and take up 4 tiles, but require more mass to sustain itself (this trend of later stages converting mass faster continues) It can provide power to most stations without much difficulty. The largest stations may require a stage 3 singularity. While containable in the same way as the earlier stages, it takes up 9 tiles. It requires a large amount of incoming mass to sustain itself, but be careful to not over-feed it, as it becomes far more difficult to contain later stages. Stage 4 and 5 singularities will tear apart walls and ordinary machinery, even through shield generators. While a stage 4 singularity can be THEORETICALLY contained (does not rip out shield generators), a stage 5 singularity will flat out consume anything containing it, and is gaurenteed to get loose. Generally, you will only see a stage 4 and 5 singularity when a singularity has already broken loose and ate enough of the station to grow to such a size. There is a fifth type of singularity, a supermatter singularity, which can only occur if a singularity eats a supermatter crystal. it takes up an enormous area, has a massive pull, and you are generally screwed if one happens to exist. Dont bother trying to contain it, it will set you on fire and turn you into an atom-thin noodle.","title":"Singularity and singularity specific machines"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide%20to%20the%20Singularity%20and%20Tesla/#tesla-and-tesla-specific-machines","text":"In comparison to the singularity, the Tesla has both numerous upsides and downsides. Like the singularity, the core of the tesla will wander aimlessly. It will emit periodic electric arc blasts. The strengh (and power generation) of these blasts is proportionate to the number of orbs orbiting the tesla itself. Upon reaching a machine or player, the arcs will do enormous damage or explode the machine (oftentimes with enough power to cause breaches). The damage from being hit by an arc is oftentimes enough to instantly kill a player, and insulated gloves will not save you. These arcs make the tesla far more dangerous when it is loose than a singularity. Unlike the singularity however, once the tesla has been set up it does not require babysitting and is easy to contain. The tesla cannot break the machinery around itself from within if the machinery is set up correctly, even if the tesla is at its maximum size. The teslas arcs will prioratize hitting grounding rods and tesla coils over everything else. Grounding rods serve to stop the arcs from damaging the coils or shield generators, and the coils convert the arcs into power. A tesla coil or a shield generator hit by an arc without any grounding WILL be damaged, which can cause the containment to fail if set up incorrectly. The tesla and the singularity are generated through near identical means, though the tesla instead uses the \"tesla generator\". Hit the tesla generator and the tesla it creates with PA blasts to create the tesla core and grow orbs around it. Unlike the singularity however, the tesla does not break loose when it is too large, so feel free to hit the PA to the maximum and leave it on.","title":"Tesla and tesla specific machines"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide%20to%20the%20Singularity%20and%20Tesla/#setting-up-the-generators","text":"0: In both cases you will want to find a 5x5 (or larger) empty region, along with space for the emitters, wiring, and the PA. Gather the appropriate material, which is the PA parts, wires, machines specific to the generator you want to create, shield generators, and emitters. The region should also have good access to the stations power grid. 1: Place the shield generators in the corners of the 5x5 (or larger) square. there should be a space of 3 tiles between them if you are using a 5x5 region. Wrench the generators down. The generators do not have to be wired to anything. 2: Place emitters facing the generators. Typically, a one tile gap is left, but this is optional. The emitters should be wired to the stations power grid or otherwise supplied with power. As emitters are dangerous and consume large amounts of power, dont turn these on yet. Remember to wrench them down one they are facing the proper direction and then weld them to the ground. 3: Move your chosen type of generator (singularity or tesla) into the very center of the construct. It should be equidistant to all of the shield generators where it can be easily hit by the PA. Wrench or weld it down if possible. 4: Build the PA. The similar looking rectangular regions with what look like red coils ontop of them should form the top of a T shape (if you aim your PA up). They are labelled as to which side they should be placed on. These, and all other parts, should be wrenched down when they are placed. Directly behind them, set up the part that looks like an exposed coil or magnet tube. The red part of it should face the regions you just placed. Behind this, set up the console interfacing part. It is rather clearly asymmetrical. If the PA is facing up, the flat region should face the right. In the adjacent region to the flat part, you should place the console itself And, to cap it all off, use the part which looks bulletlike. Wire the console or any part of the PA to a power source. The PA demands very large amounts of power, so a plasma generator, the station grid, or existing reactor is reccomended. Test fire the PA (FOR ONE BLAST!) at the construct to see if it works. There should be nothing in the path of the PA. Floors and glass are fine, as are tables, but grilles, emitters, shield generators, and walls will block the particles. Notably, the energy barrier put up by shield generators will not block the particles. 4.5 A: If you are making a singularity: place radiation collectors along the outside of where the shield field will be generated. wrench them down. they should not block the PA particle's paths. Deploy them by clicking them. Wire them to a transformer and other electrical converters 4.5 B: If you are making a tesla: Place one tesla coil at each side of the construct except for the one facing the PA. At the same time, place one or two grounding rods on each side. Wire the tesla coils to a transformer or other electrical devices and be sure that they are wrenched in place. 5: Turn on the emitters. If they were set up correctly this should be as simple as clicking on them. otherwise, check that they are secured and powered. 6: Wait for the emitters to power the shield generators. This is represented by a bar on the shield generator that will slowly fill up with a light blue color as the generator gets more power 7: When the generators are full, turn them on. This will create the shield field. 8: Return to the PA and turn it on. This will create a contained singularity or tesla which will begin creating power. Be sure to keep it fed, but not too large.

Overview \u00b6 Electricity in US is a system that appears very complex on the surface but is in reality very simple to understand. This guide will cover safety, electricity consuming devices, types of wires, APCs (not the armoured vehicles), department/local batteries, transformers, station power storage, and simple generators as well as how to sabotage and repair the electrical grid. How not to become a lightbulb \u00b6 As in real life, high voltages and large amounts of power are dangerous, and can very easily kill you if not respected. To remain safe while fixing or destroying the power grid, there are several things you can do. The most potent and capable defence against electrical shocks is insulated gloves, which are able to block almost all form of electrical shocks, the budget variety offers some protection as well, but nowhere near the guaranteed protection of the engineering-grade ones. Cutting and merging powered wires without gloves will almost always result in shocks that deal large amounts of burn damage, scaling with the power involved, which can easily kill you. if you do not have access to gloves, you can try to shut down power to the wires to safely connect/cut them by interacting with power controllers, such as the APC, department battery, or station power source. Power Consuming Devices \u00b6 Most devices on the station, from consoles to the bar dispenser all require a constant supply of power to function. If the power supply collapses or the demand for power exceeds generated power, these devices will stop working, effectively halting the station. All lightbulbs require power, and not powering the lights is a sure-fire way to invoke the broken window effect. Cloning will also not function without power, meaning dead bodies will pile up and not be revived. Types of Wires \u00b6 Rather than a single type of wire, the station's power supply is made of a network of many types of wires. Low voltage wires are cheap, but can only handle smaller amounts of power. Medium power wires are the most common type of wire and are used in hacking doors. High voltage wires are the rarest type of wires and can handle the enormous loads made by nuclear reactors and generators, they act as the spine upon which the rest of the station's grid is built. Area Power Controllers (APCs) \u00b6 These devices (most of them) receive power from their local APC. APCs can be found just about everywhere, and typically control the power distribution of a single room. If an APC is receiving power, it will automatically distribute it to other devices. Devices not powered by an APC can instead be powered by a physical wire connection to a power supply. APCs themselves are connected by low voltage wires to department batteries. If clicked on, they will open a menu, on which you can read various statistics about the APC. Department Batteries \u00b6 Department batteries, as the name implies, control the power distribution of power to larger department sized areas. They do not power machines themselves, instead, they connect to APCs which distribute power for them. Department batteries are connected by Medium voltage wires back to the engineering department, where they are connected to SMES devices. Batteries can be turned on and off by clicking on them. SMES devices \u00b6 SMES devices are effectively just upscaled department batteries. They distribute power to department batteries through medium voltage wires. They receive their power from Transformers, to which they are connected by medium-voltage wires. When clicked on they open a menu from which how much power they store and how much they distribute per tick can be altered. Transformers \u00b6 Transformers are simple, in effect, they are just a way of linking high voltage wires with medium voltage wires. they do not have a menu when clicked on and cannot be turned on or off. They serve an important role in allowing the station's power source to connect to SMES devices which distribute the power it generates. Simple generators \u00b6 Unlike the reactor, generators are incredibly simple. they produce a large amount of electricity by burning solid plasma, but require a constant supply to function. plasma can be inserted into generators by clicking the generator with plasma in hand. generators can then be turned on by clicking them. The amount of power produced by generators is so large that not even insulated gloves, or even the captain's gloves, will protect you when cutting directly connected wires, they can and will kill you instantly. if you need to change the wiring, turn the generator off first. Diagnostics and repair \u00b6 All too often electrical devices may find themselves unpowered due to issues in the gird. Fortunately, there is an easy step by step guide that can be used to fix almost any electrical issue. 0: if the station is unpowered, skip to step 3. if a department is unpowered, skip to step 2. otherwise move to step 1. 1: Check the APC for the room the device is in. If it is receiving power, your device is simply not connected. try moving it. occasionally a devices power requirements may exceed what an APC can provide, in which case, you should manually link it using medium-voltage wires to the stations medium voltage wire grid. if the APC is not receiving power, move to step two 2: Follow the APC's low voltage wiring to the department battery. on the way, check for any breaks in the wires. cut wires, obviously, will not transmit power. Mice will often nibble at power cables, so killing mice in maint is recommended. If the connection to the battery is broken, repair it and check the APC. if the APC is powered but the device isn't, move back to step one. If the APC is still not receiving power, Move to check the department battery. if it is off, turn it on. check if the battery is distributing stored power, or if it is actually receiving power. If it is the prior, move on to step three, if the device still isn't working, return to step one. 3: Either badger an engineer to check power, or do so yourself. engineering is restricted to non-engineers, so it is often best simply letting one fix the problem for you. to fix the issue of the battery not being supplied, follow its medium-voltage wires to the SMESs. repair any breaks. If there were breaks and you repaired them, check if the battery is receiving power or the device works. If the prior is false, repeat step two, if the latter is false move to step one. If the connection is solid, check the SMESs themselves and see if they are receiving and distributing power. If the SMESs are not receiving power, move onto step 4, if they are not distributing it, fix it and move to step one. 4:Follow the connection to the reactor/generator. Make sure there is a transformer making the power wires transition from medium to high, and that there are no breaks. If there are breaks, fix them, and return to step 3. If there are no breaks and power is still not distributed, check to see if the generator/reactor is operating, if it isn't, fix it. if power is still not distributed, return to step three. power sabotage \u00b6 The station's power supply is remarkably fragile, and a single man with access to maintenance and a wirecutter can easily cripple multiple departments. Low voltage wires to APCs can be cut to disrupt single rooms, and while not very crippling are rarely fixed. Medium wires and batteries supply entire departments, and if broken or cut can stop it from functioning. Finally, Destroying the generator, SMESs, cutting SMES wires, or cutting generator-transformer wires can all cut power to the entire station.","title":"Guide To Electricity"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide-To-Electricity/#guide-to-electricity","text":"Relevent guides: Construction , Nuclear Reactor Note: This is not a guide to the operation of the nuclear reactor or building electrical equipment, that is linked directly above.","title":"Guide to electricity"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide-To-Electricity/#overview","text":"Electricity in US is a system that appears very complex on the surface but is in reality very simple to understand.

Overview \u00b6 Every tile in US13, even those covered by walls and doors or in space, simulates its atmosphere to a large degree of complexity. Each tile can change in pressure, temperature, gas mixture, flammability, etc. very few of these conditions are habitable, and it is the job of Atmos Techs to maintain them. Before one changes the station's atmosphere, however, it is best to understand it, whether to do one's job safely or make ones sabotage more effective. Tanks \u00b6 Gas tanks, commonly confused with gas canisters, are small and portable methods of storing and distributing gasses. All jobs start with an oxygen tank and mask in the box within their backpack which is useful if the atmosphere happens to have none. There exist rarer larger capacity variants, coloured yellow, and large tanks that cannot fit in the backpack but contain far more oxygen than the small emergency canisters and are good for spacewalks and extended operations such as mining. These tanks do not and cannot contain an infinite amount of gas. if you are relying on them for a spacewalk, they will eventually run out, so it is recommended you bring a backup on very extended walks. The tanks can be filled with gasses from canisters after being inserted into them, though it is recommended to empty the tanks first. Canisters \u00b6 Canisters are far larger containers of gas. They cannot be carried and hand and must be pulled one at a time, and require tools to interface and interact with various atmos systems. Unlike oxygen tanks, canisters come containing various gases at round start, with only a select few not available. they are MUCH better suited for the demands of station-wide atmos management due to their larger capacity, and can be turned into devastating weapons with a little effort. Canisters can be hooked onto special tiles by clicking on them with a wrench in hand. when this is done, the canister and pipe will begin to equalize pressure and gasses. This means that when a canister is hooked up to an empty pipe system, it will fill the pipes with its gas. if a canister (typically empty) is hooked to a pressurized pipe, it will be filled instead. A special case is shuttles, when a plasma tank is hooked up aboard a shuttle, the gas will be used as fuel for its engines, reducing the amount of gas as the shuttle is piloted. The above operations don't require accessing the canisters menu, but it is still worth knowing how to read it. it contains a valve, button to toggle gas release, button to fill (read, equalize) a tank that is inserted, and various readings of values such as set release pressure, internal pressure, etc. The valve controls the release pressure, or the pressure gas is released from the canister when the release is toggled (and the canister is not hooked to a tile). All the gas inside a canister can be violently released if the canister is broken, be it by firearms or melee The main use of canisters (aside from acting as buffer/storage for atmos) is to flood fill rooms with the gasses contained inside. this can be done benevolently to fill an oxygenless area or one previously spaced, or malevolently to fill it with hot plasma. Gases \u00b6 Rather than a plain and boring single \"atmosphere\" gas commonly present in other games with atmosphere simulations, there are a large variety of gases that can make up the atmosphere in an area or pipe Starting with by far the most important, oxygen, the reason why it's needed should be abundantly clear. without oxygen players will rapidly take damage and die, thankfully everyone has an oxygen tank on them at roundstart, and many can be found around the station, but a sudden disappearance of oxygen is still very capable of killing numerous people. Something learned from the Apollo 1 crew is that, yes, there is such a thing as too much oxygen. If the atmosphere in an area is almost all oxygen, any flammable gas (plasma) can be ignited very easily and will get extremely hot very quickly. Though this is dangerous, controlled burns in special chambers are a great way for atmospherics to create some more exotic gases, as with the right combinations tritium and pluoxium can be created. The second gas that you will probably have to worry about is plasma. This (oddly named) substance isn't actually plasma, but instead a McGuffin flammable gas. If it is in the air, the air can catch fire, so don't let it find a spark. Plasma burns can reach very high temperatures with large amounts of oxygen, but this will rapidly consume the plasma. Low oxygen burns on the other hand are much colder but will last for very long periods of time. all plasma fires can light you on fire, which will deal large amounts of burn damage, increasing depending on how \"on fire\" you are. This can be countered through the use of specialized suits and hardsuits. Plasma fires are best fought back by venting an area or nitrogen flooding it, but fire extinguishers are an easy and portable way of putting out smaller fires. Nitrogen and Carbon dioxide are almost functionally identical. Both can be used to fill up space so an area is not completely made of one gas. Carbon dioxide is less common, but generated by fires and breathing, while Nitrogen makes up the majority of the air at roundstart and can be found in several canisters. Carbon dioxide is generally filtered out of the atmosphere, though this can actually backfire when controlling fires, as carbon dioxide is great at snuffing them out and when piped out of a fire is at a high pressure and can \"clog\" the waste pipes by crowding out other gasses. There are also rarer and more specialized gasses. N2O, aka laughing gas, can typically be found in tanks within medbays surgical rooms and within atmos. it is intended as a way of knocking players out but is currently nonfunctional. BZ is a potent hallucinogenic agent that can be found within xenobio in science on some maps, it is similarly nonfunctional. Pluoxium can be seen as \"safe oxygen\", it can replace oxygen in the atmosphere and be breathable, in fact being more effective than oxygen, and tends to be inert and non-reactive, making it an excellent way of controlling fires. Tritium is the exact opposite, created in high-temperature plasma fires in small amounts, large amounts of pure tritium act as a VERY potent fire \"accelerant\" or catalyst, allowing them to reach some absurd temperatures that even hardsuits won't save you from. it should be noted that tritium cannot burn on its own, and must be mixed with plasma and oxygen. Miasma is the rarest gas and does nothing as of now, it is created by dead bodies in small amounts, and is intended to trigger effects such as vomiting, disgust, and mood debuffs if in large amounts. In summary of the gases and their availability roundstart in several containers: Picture Name Purpose Tanks? Canisters? Oxygen Breathable, Fire oxidizer. Yes Yes Plasma Flammable, Fuel, Making other gases No (planned) Yes Nitrogen Space-filling, Inert. No Yes Carbon Dioxide Space-filling, Inert. No sometimes N2O Non-functional Knockout Yes (rare) Yes BZ Non-functional Hallucinations/brain damage No sometimes Pluoxium Oxygen replacement, inert No No Tritium Fire \"accelerant\" No No Miasma Non-functional disgust/vomit/bad smell No No \"Air\" Pre-mixed nitrogen and oxygen Maybe? Yes \"Empty\" Empty canister, for filling. No Yes Pipes, Manifolds, heat exchangers, etc \u00b6 While in-air atmospherics is already rather complicated, it goes into the realm of complete absurdity once one factors in piping. many pipes with many different gases and many different purposes criss-cross the entire station in an enormous web, all converging onto the atmospherics sub-department itself. Outside of atmospherics itself, most of the more complex types of pipes and pipe-interfacers won't be found, and most crew will only have to worry about a few types. Air pipes, connecting to vents, that distribute air (or whatever atmos has substituted) throughout the station, waste pipes (connected to scrubbers) that carry away plasma and carbon dioxide when on, and junctions, regions where several pipes converge or split off. Within atmospherics, however, it is an entirely different beast. Many types of filters and distributors and heaters and coolers litter the area, and the pipes form an incredibly complex spider web. This guide will not be explaining the various regions of the atmospherics sub-department, however, only the individual functions of each type of pipe and pipe-interfacer.

Each of these can cause varying things to occur at different values Low and high pressure will both cause brute damage. This is to say that getting hit by a shockwave of pressure and walking in space without a spacesuit will both be bad for your health low volumes bottleneck gases, while high volumes, such as in open air or canisters, allow for large amounts of gas to be stored without issue. Low molarity does nothing, it simply means there is a small amount of gas. High molarity means there is a large amount of gas. if there is enough volume, this is not an issue, but low volumes will cause a large increase in pressure. especially dangerous are gases at a high molarity and very low temperature, as a large amount can be fit into a canister or tank, and when released and equalized with the air will massively increase in pressure. Both high and low temperatures will deal burn damage. This does not mean you have to be on fire, a very hot oven-like room will cook you just as well. The cold of space will also deal damage to those poorly insulated. advanced atmospherics \u00b6 Atmos is both the hardest to learn and hardest to master region of SS13, and most don't bother past the basics. For the skilled atmostech, there are however great rewards, even beyond circle-jerking to how hot you got plasma to get. A master atmos tech can stop fires before they even begin and give helpful buffs to the entire station, and if a traitor, turn into the most potent hellfire one has ever seen. what makes atmos especially powerful is its self-reliance. while jobs like roboticist and chemist rely on others, like mining and botany, to get powerful, the atmos tech can build a chamber that makes the sun look like Canada in comparison with only his own know-how and tools, no other department required. Learning atmos is more than just knowing what each part does, and to really understand it it is recommended that you play atmos tech and experiment and communicate with other experienced atmos techs to share ideas.

All jobs start with an oxygen tank and mask in the box within their backpack which is useful if the atmosphere happens to have none. There exist rarer larger capacity variants, coloured yellow, and large tanks that cannot fit in the backpack but contain far more oxygen than the small emergency canisters and are good for spacewalks and extended operations such as mining. These tanks do not and cannot contain an infinite amount of gas. if you are relying on them for a spacewalk, they will eventually run out, so it is recommended you bring a backup on very extended walks. The tanks can be filled with gasses from canisters after being inserted into them, though it is recommended to empty the tanks first.","title":"Tanks"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide-to-Atmospherics/#canisters","text":"Canisters are far larger containers of gas. They cannot be carried and hand and must be pulled one at a time, and require tools to interface and interact with various atmos systems. Unlike oxygen tanks, canisters come containing various gases at round start, with only a select few not available. they are MUCH better suited for the demands of station-wide atmos management due to their larger capacity, and can be turned into devastating weapons with a little effort. Canisters can be hooked onto special tiles by clicking on them with a wrench in hand. when this is done, the canister and pipe will begin to equalize pressure and gasses. This means that when a canister is hooked up to an empty pipe system, it will fill the pipes with its gas. if a canister (typically empty) is hooked to a pressurized pipe, it will be filled instead. A special case is shuttles, when a plasma tank is hooked up aboard a shuttle, the gas will be used as fuel for its engines, reducing the amount of gas as the shuttle is piloted. The above operations don't require accessing the canisters menu, but it is still worth knowing how to read it. it contains a valve, button to toggle gas release, button to fill (read, equalize) a tank that is inserted, and various readings of values such as set release pressure, internal pressure, etc. The valve controls the release pressure, or the pressure gas is released from the canister when the release is toggled (and the canister is not hooked to a tile). All the gas inside a canister can be violently released if the canister is broken, be it by firearms or melee The main use of canisters (aside from acting as buffer/storage for atmos) is to flood fill rooms with the gasses contained inside. this can be done benevolently to fill an oxygenless area or one previously spaced, or malevolently to fill it with hot plasma.","title":"Canisters"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide-to-Atmospherics/#gases","text":"Rather than a plain and boring single \"atmosphere\" gas commonly present in other games with atmosphere simulations, there are a large variety of gases that can make up the atmosphere in an area or pipe Starting with by far the most important, oxygen, the reason why it's needed should be abundantly clear. without oxygen players will rapidly take damage and die, thankfully everyone has an oxygen tank on them at roundstart, and many can be found around the station, but a sudden disappearance of oxygen is still very capable of killing numerous people. Something learned from the Apollo 1 crew is that, yes, there is such a thing as too much oxygen. If the atmosphere in an area is almost all oxygen, any flammable gas (plasma) can be ignited very easily and will get extremely hot very quickly. Though this is dangerous, controlled burns in special chambers are a great way for atmospherics to create some more exotic gases, as with the right combinations tritium and pluoxium can be created. The second gas that you will probably have to worry about is plasma. This (oddly named) substance isn't actually plasma, but instead a McGuffin flammable gas. If it is in the air, the air can catch fire, so don't let it find a spark. Plasma burns can reach very high temperatures with large amounts of oxygen, but this will rapidly consume the plasma. Low oxygen burns on the other hand are much colder but will last for very long periods of time. all plasma fires can light you on fire, which will deal large amounts of burn damage, increasing depending on how \"on fire\" you are. This can be countered through the use of specialized suits and hardsuits. Plasma fires are best fought back by venting an area or nitrogen flooding it, but fire extinguishers are an easy and portable way of putting out smaller fires. Nitrogen and Carbon dioxide are almost functionally identical. Both can be used to fill up space so an area is not completely made of one gas. Carbon dioxide is less common, but generated by fires and breathing, while Nitrogen makes up the majority of the air at roundstart and can be found in several canisters. Carbon dioxide is generally filtered out of the atmosphere, though this can actually backfire when controlling fires, as carbon dioxide is great at snuffing them out and when piped out of a fire is at a high pressure and can \"clog\" the waste pipes by crowding out other gasses. There are also rarer and more specialized gasses. N2O, aka laughing gas, can typically be found in tanks within medbays surgical rooms and within atmos. it is intended as a way of knocking players out but is currently nonfunctional. BZ is a potent hallucinogenic agent that can be found within xenobio in science on some maps, it is similarly nonfunctional. Pluoxium can be seen as \"safe oxygen\", it can replace oxygen in the atmosphere and be breathable, in fact being more effective than oxygen, and tends to be inert and non-reactive, making it an excellent way of controlling fires. Tritium is the exact opposite, created in high-temperature plasma fires in small amounts, large amounts of pure tritium act as a VERY potent fire \"accelerant\" or catalyst, allowing them to reach some absurd temperatures that even hardsuits won't save you from. it should be noted that tritium cannot burn on its own, and must be mixed with plasma and oxygen. Miasma is the rarest gas and does nothing as of now, it is created by dead bodies in small amounts, and is intended to trigger effects such as vomiting, disgust, and mood debuffs if in large amounts.

Overview \u00b6 This guide will cover the basic background info of the reactor, how to start it, how to run it, and how to blow it to hell. Many terms relating to the reactor will also be covered, under the assumption that you are almost certainly not a nuclear physicist. Background \u00b6 Before you even touch the reactor, its best you know how it works Pipes, steam, water, and a shit-ton of radiation \u00b6 The reactor has several distinct parts, all of which must be properly connected to each-other for the reactor to work. Starting with the simplest, the water reservoir. It holds water. This water is cycled around the reactor through the use of a pump,it heads to the reactor core where it is heated to steam by the fission reactions within and used to drive a turbine, creating power. the water then returns to the reservoir where it is cooled, and the process begins again. This whole system has, as of now, only two weak links, the pipes and the reactor core. The other parts of the reactor can be built with cheap steel in the build menu, but the pipes and core are both difficult to replace and require leanghy repiping and large amounts of plasteel respectively. How the core works \u00b6 The core itself is just as complex as the rest of the reactor combined. Inside the core, fuel rods are used in fission reactions to heat up water cycling through the core. These fuel rods cannot start up on their own, and require a starting rod to fire up initially. Control rods are used to reduce or increase the rate of fission reactions to control the core. The cores pressure and temperature are what you need to control to generate power and avoid getting your teeth kicked in by an admin, Though these are not directly controllable and make up a large chain of dependence. The chain of dependence \u00b6 As previously mentioned, the temperature and pressure of a core are not directly controllable, only indirectly through a long series of dependencies. Starting from the beginning, you have the number of rods. More fuel rods means more heat and neutrons, while more control rods means more control over other values. The second thing you have control over is rod height. When the control rods are deep in the reactor, they lower the amount of fission reactions that occur, and when they are nearly outside it, the amount of reactions increases. This is measured by the K% value (or more accurately a 1+k%), which shows on a triplet of horizontal sliding gauges. This K% value changes the amount of neutron flux exponentially, meaning a K% value of 10 causes the flux to grow not ten times faster than a k value of 1, but a hundred times faster. The neutron flux can be seen as a way to measure how active the reactor is. The higher the flux, the more fission reactions occur. This causes the temperature to increase which in turn increases the pressure of the steam around the reactor. The higher the pressure, the faster the steam moves through the turbine, and the more power is generated. If all this has you confused, try reading the chain of dependency backwards. Reading the console \u00b6 With recent changes to the reactor control console, its become easier but more complicated to read than before. The K slider has been given two extra gauges for finer readings, these are more difficult to explain verbally than with examples, so well get right to those. If the value of K# was 0.71, the top slider would be ~2/3rds between 0 and 1, the second slider measuring increments of 1/10th would be at 7, and the finest display at the bottom would be off its right far end. Alternatively, if it was at 0.07, both the top and second slider would be close to zero, with the lower slider at 7. If you want a k value that is perfectly at zero, you should have all 3 gauges centred along the centerline. The reactor rod controls are far easier than before. there is a display showing the % of the max depth the rods are inserted at any moment down to the hundredth of a percent. The left course slider controls this depth at increments of 1%, while the right one does so at increments of 0.01%. The latter is essential for achiving a perfect 0 k value. Areas of gauges that are shaded in red mean that having a value in the range is either counterproductive or dangerous. A pressure incapable of powering the reactor and a pressure close to blowing it up would both be in a red shaded area. Starting up the reactor \u00b6 Starting up the reactor is a rather long process, with multiple steps, and can result in you turning into a fine mist if done incorrectly. Rods \u00b6 Before starting the reactor, you need to gather what you'll need to do so. these are the rods, typically found someplace near the console. There are three types, control rods, whose function is discussed in \"The chain of dependence\", Fuel rods, which drive the fission reactions and are slowly whittled down by them, and starter rods, which provide the initial neutrons for starting up the reactor. These must be placed into the reactor in an appropriate ratio to avoid it fizzling out or exploding horribly. \"Simple\" reactor setup \u00b6 This is simply the method that I personally use when I'm just looking to generate power. Id recommend experimenting on private servers if you want to try different setups, as admins frown upon unscheduled reactor decommissioning. Start the plasma generator so crew doesn't complain and your lights/consoles are powered. Gather 4 to 5 control rods, one fuel rod, and one starter rod. Head out the airlock and plug in the control rods. then the fuel rod, then the starter. run back inside to man the reactor console Raise control rods until the k% value is ~ 6 or 7 Keep it there until the neutron flux reaches a point between 10^5 and 10^6. Going higher will make the reactor MUCH more feisty, exponentially so. (going too high will result in a reactor meltdown that cant be stopped via the console) Set K% to zero using the rods. (all 3 sliders should meet at the center point, see \"Reading the console\") Lower and raise K% until a stable and relatively high temp and pressure is reached (being in the top-side red is safe-ish, going above it results in reactor failure) Check that pressure is rising, and use the other console to see if power is being generated go to the core, remove the starter rod, be sure your wearing rad-proof gear. go back to the console, repeat steps 7-9 as needed Continued operation \u00b6 Now that you've got the reactor running, you are expected to keep it nice, fueled, and stable. Refueling \u00b6 The step by step setup should be good for most rounds, lasting over an hour, but if you need to refuel the reactor, head out the airlock, take out the old fuel rod, smack in a new one, and repeat the startup process. Its a good idea to startup the plasma generator beforehand so the crew doesn't complain about the lack of power. If your using a multi fuel rod setup, having someone trustworthy man the console while your replacing rods is generally a good idea. Safety hazards \u00b6 Having a very slowly exploding nuke in your backyard comes with a lot of dangers, not the least of which is may blow you into tiny smithereens if you fuck up. Therefore, it is always a good idea to be aware of the various safety hazards it poses. The two largest dangers come down to the fact that the reactor is sometimes in exposed space, and that it emits a massive amount of radiation. The first is easily counter-able, just grab a hardsuit, Engineering hardsuit preferred, tack on an o2 tank, and wear a mask. The second is more difficult. Even a single fuel rod reactor emits a massive amount of radiation, and anyone near it not wearing radiation protective gear will slowly melt from the inside. The tile above the reactor core, as well as those directly next to it, are typically so radioactive that even this wont help you totally, and even in a full Engineering hardsuit you will rapidly begin turning into goo if you get too close. Meltdown prevention \u00b6 Preventing a meltdown is very simple, and there are two ways to do it. Number one is to slam the control rods all the way in once the reactor tries to meltdown, which may not be fast enough if you get there too late. The second option is to go outside yourself and manually take out any fuel rods. If you fail at either, you will be turned into a red unclonable mist still alive and just floating in space because explosions dont damage people yet. Sabotage prevention \u00b6 If you want to prevent someone from turning engineering into a crater on purpose, there are a few things you can try. There are two places you need to protect, but still have accessible, these being the reactor and its control console. If you want to prevent sabotage, walling up the reactor and leaving an engineering airlock is typically the best course of action. The console is typically decently protected, but if you feel the need you can replace the windows with reinforced walls or place the console in a more hidden location. \ud83c\udfb5 I dont want to set the wooorld on fiiiire \ud83c\udfb5 \u00b6 So, lets say you're a traitor and need all of engineering gone. There are a few ways you can go about detonating the reactor, depending on if you approach the console or the core first. Chernobyl \u00b6 The Chernobyl method is fucking with the console and moving the control rods as far out as you can and hoping nobody notices, before blitzing the fuck out of engineering so you don't end up dead yourself. This will take a longer time to come to fruition, and is easier to both stop and repair, but is far less difficult to set up than the other method Ghetto Tsar Bomba \u00b6 If you've got a deathwish, and access to the rods themselves, this method guarantees the biggest boom. to do it, simply take out all the rods in the core, shove in only fuel rods, smack in a starter, and RUN LIKE HELL. This is more difficult to set up but cannot be stopped using the console and can guarantee that the reactor explosion is absolutely massive. This will guarantee a shuttle call and will most certainly get you sent to the void if you aren't an antagonist or have a VERY VERY good reason for doing so.","title":"Guide to the nuclear reactor"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide-to-the-nuclear-reactor/#guide-to-the-nuclear-reactor","text":"Note: The reactor is VERY complicated, and you shouldn't touch it unless you are experienced as an engineer or fully intend to fuck it up.","title":"Guide to the nuclear reactor"},{"location":"Guides/Engineering%20guides/Guide-to-the-nuclear-reactor/#overview","text":"This guide will cover the basic background info of the reactor, how to start it, how to run it, and how to blow it to hell.

The first is easily counter-able, just grab a hardsuit, Engineering hardsuit preferred, tack on an o2 tank, and wear a mask. The second is more difficult. Even a single fuel rod reactor emits a massive amount of radiation, and anyone near it not wearing radiation protective gear will slowly melt from the inside.

While the base upon which it is built on is itself rather intricate, the myriad of interacting mechanics introduced by other systems increases its complexity exponentially. This, aswell as the social element, lends itself well to making combat in unitystation more tactically unique. Unfortunately (or fortunately?) this makes combat in unitystation very difficult to master. While this guide will by no means cover all the details (wed be here all week), it should introduce and teach the core combat system, aswell as provide practical advice for combat and how to work towards a better understanding. Core systems \u00b6 The very core of the combat system is a combination of parts of the intent and health systems. Intents are important to learn to interact with the combat system, and health is good to know to reduce how often you die, and allow you to more effectively choose targets. Intents \u00b6 There are 4 intents . Help, grab, disarm and harm Help (green) \u00b6 Help intent, as implied by the name, is mainly used for non-combat interactions. It is still useful to know. If you on help intent, and not carrying a weapon in your hands, you cannot injure others, and will swap places/pass those you run into rather than stopping (good for chasing someone or being on the run). Using help intent on someone (including yourself) with medecine in hand will apply the medecine to a selected body part, healing it (assuming you apply the correct meds). Grab (yellow) \u00b6 Grab intent will grab the person you use it on. By moving, they can break out of your grab. When someone is grabbed, and not resisting, you can pull them, much the same as ctrl + click. If someone is handcuffed, they will be unable to break out of your grab, letting you pull them into a prison cell if your merciful, or into a discrete location if your not. Disarm (blue) \u00b6 Dont let the name fool you, disarm plays a far bigger role than just wrenching a weapon out of someones hands. If used on another player, they have a very good chance to drop their weapon, which you can then pick up, and possibly use (note, some guns are locked by id-based firing pins). If you absolutely must fight someone who is equipped, and are unarmed, DONT use the harm intent. use the disarm intent and use their own weapons against them. This also works in reverse, dont get in melee range if you have a gun, as you will likely get disarmed and lit up with your own gun. While you cant avoid getting in melee range if your using a melee weapon, you can minimize the risk of being disarmed by spending as little time in melee range as possible (in open combat) and instead using Hit-and-Retreat methods, or by surprising/ambushing your foe to (hopefully) chop them up before they react. Disarm doesnt stop there, though. Each individual disarm has a small chance to knock over the person being disarmed. While knocked down, people are stunned, and cannot shoot or melee back against attacks. The time given by a disarm knockdown is NOT enough to handcuff people, dont make the mistake of coming close to an angry man with a gun with only one free hand of your own. When someone is knocked down, if you are very quick, you can loot a few items from them. This can be anything on their person, from backpacks, to hidden guns, to their ID. If you plan on doing this to get your hands on a juicy ID or traitor objective, be sure you know where they are probably located in the persons inventory. Harm (red) \u00b6 Harm intent, as is obvious from the name, is used to injure others with raw brute force. If you are on harm intent, you will attempt to hit those you click on in melee range (even if holding a gun!) with the weapon in hand. Weapons can all still be used in other intents, and harm is mostly an intent there to make sure you dont accidentally help someone. While in harm, you wont be able to apply medicine, help others up, etc. clicking someone while in harm intent with an empty hand will punch them, dealing a moderate amount of damage, but not enough to fight off a person who has a proper weapon. The health system \u00b6 In unitystation, health is much more complex than in most games. health can be decreased directly by 4 types of damage, two of which are applied to individual limbs. The total health is the base health, minus damage dealt to limbs, and minus damage dealt by other causes. This means that enough damage to a single limb can kill, even if it is the only limb damaged. Damage types \u00b6 Brute damage is dealt by ballistic weapons, most melee weapons, and punches. It can be healed with bandages, and is applied to individual limbs. Burn damage is similarly applied to individual limbs. it can be healed with ointment, and is dealt by lasers and fires. oxygen damage is caused by being in critical condition, or by a lack of air. It can be slowed with CPR (help intent on downed critical person) and is best healed by getting somewhere one can breathe, or by healing to take a person out of a critical state. Toxin/poision damage is caused mainly by toxins, and is harder to heal than other damage types, requiring specific chemicals to fix. Limb targetting \u00b6 On your hud, there is a small doll. when bodyparts are clicked, they will be targeted. this allows you to heal or injure specific regions. different parts have different chances to be successfully hit (head is harder to hit than the torso for example). If an attack misses, it will most likely instead connect with another bodypart, only rarely will you whiff an attack entirely. The more injured you are, the more likely you are to miss. These body parts will also be targeted when firing a gun. Various maladies \u00b6 Especilly worthile to note are the many situational effects and objects that play large roles in combat. Stuns \u00b6 Players can be stunned in several ways. Disarms can disable them for a short period, as can tazers, while stun batons can knock someone to the ground for a long enough period to arrest them. It should be noted, again, that tazers and disarms will not give you enough time to fill the handcuff progress bar before the person your arresting gets back up. Stunned players can be looted by dragging their sprite onto your own, as can handcuffed people. Handcuffs \u00b6 Handcuffs can be applied at any time, but require time to put on. This means you cant just approach a man with a knife and cuff him, not without disabling him first. one of the few reliable methods to get this time is the stun baton, which can knock someone to the ground long enough to let you handcuff them. Those in cuffs cannot harm, punch, pick up objects, or resist grabs, meaning they can be safely moved to a different location. Keep in mind they can still talk on the radio, unless you take that too. Blindness \u00b6 While more rare, temporary blindness can be inflicted by flashbangs and portable flashes. While blind you can interact and run around, but cannot see. Frankly, blind people are incredibly unpredictable, so blinding someone will probably make it harder, not easier, to land a stun on them. Weapons \u00b6 There is a very large amount of weapons in unitystation, and learning which weapons are best for which jobs is good for maximizing effectiveness firearms \u00b6 Most firearms shoot either lasers or bullets. Lasers can pass through windows and deal mainly burn damage, while guns deal brute damage. Lasers \u00b6 Laser weapons only have a few set types of bolts, only two of which are very common. Tazer/electric bolts stun players on impact for a short period, disabler bolts stun them for what is basically no time at all, \"kill\" lasers deal a moderate amount of burn damage, and disruptor bolts deal ridiculous amounts of damage capeable of melting walls. Laser and energy based weapons like them must be charged at charging stations, with very few exceptions. bullets \u00b6 There is a very large variety in ammunition in US, hell, almost every gun takes a different type of bullet. many of these bullets can also come in augmented forms, such as AP, hollow point, incindiary, and more. Guns clips must be ejected when the gun is empty by clicking the gun in hand, and must be loaded by clicking on the gun while holding a magazine. Bullets are typically more damaging than lasers, but the requirment of carrying around clips and lack of rapid adaptability means lasers still compete well. Fully automatic weapons \u00b6 Full auto weapons, such as smgs and machine guns, will continue firing for as long as you hold down the mouse. While capeable of rapidly killing people, they burn through ammo equally fast, and thus must be reloaded often. they are also rather inaccurate. Per-shot, they typically deal less damage than other weapons. They are great at mowing down single targets if you have plenty of down-time to reload and prepare, and are great at killing those you are chasing, but struggle in more extended fights, when there is little opportunity to recover, and struggle at long range, forcing you close to danger.. Semi automatic weapons \u00b6 These fire once when you press the mouse button, are typically higher damage per shot, and are rather accurate. This means you can kill people without placing yourself in too much danger, and conserve ammunition. semi-auto weapons that can fire with little cooldown are equally effective in ambushes as automatic weapons, but those with longer cooldowns (such as rifles and lasers) struggle to kill people before they can flee. One exception to this is the sniper, which has a large cooldown but is great in ambushes, simply due to its massive damage per shot. Seni auto weapons cant mow people down as fast as full auto weapons, but let you be safer and conserve ammunition. melee weapons \u00b6 Melee weapons are inherantly far riskier than ranged ones, but can greatly reward the risk if utilized smartly. Unlike guns, most melee weapons (with few exceptions) follow the same simple point and stab interface. How you use a melee weapon can however change depending on just how effective and rare it is. Low effectiveness/improvised/punches \u00b6 Improvised weapons (chairs, fire extinguishers, etc) are far less effective than other melee weapons, but their accessability means they are often all you have. When using these, you can rush down and take more chances to be disarmed than someone using a more potent weapon, as you can simply grab another if you lose yours. This means your best off moving side to side facing a target, bashing on them repetedly, or trading disarms (especilly if you are unarmed). These weapons should not be used to try and assassinate someone, as theyll more than likely run off, but they are great for self defence. High effectiveness melee weapons \u00b6 Purpouse made melee weapons, such as eswords and sabers, are rarer, but a lot more devestating. their main weakness is less their own, and more because they can be disarmed and used against you, and you cant easily get another one. Therefore, when you have one of these, you want to minimize how much time they can disarm you. This can be done either by chopping them up before they can react in an ambush, or by only taking short periods to attack. Rather than berserk at your foe, you want to stay a tile or two seperate from them, and pop into melee range unexpectedly to give them a quick stab before jumping back out. Thrown weapons \u00b6 There are three main types of throwing weapons. improvised, dedicated, and grenades. objects can be thrown after using the \"throw\" button, or after using the (default) hotkey \"r\". Improvised throwing weapons \u00b6 Melee weapons (like swords) thrown at attackers and other items, such as floor tiles, fall into this category. The rapidity with which items can be thrown, plus the decent damge per throw, means that thrown weapons can be unexpectedly deadly, even if makeshift. Particularly adventagous for improvised weapons is the plentitude of ammunition. Floor tiles make good throwing weapons, as do chairs and fire extinguishers, and they are absolutely goddamn everywhere. This means that you can engage in ranged combat, even without a dedicated ranged weapon, giving you the advantage over those using melee weapons. dedicated throwing weapons \u00b6 Few of these exist, and the fact that they can be thrown back makes them a hard sell. They do not do enough to justify their low quanitity. if you have them, use them, but i would advise against actively looking for them. Grenades \u00b6 Grenades, on the other hand, absolutely justify their rarity. even ignoring chemistry, grenades can one shot people, force them to run, and, atop all this, can be \"cooked\" To use a grenade, you must first activate it by clicking it in hand. at which point you will throw it at the next location you click (pressing R or the throw button will make you keep holding it, so dont touch them.) When the grenade timer finishes, it will explode, greatly damaging players and objects in the blast. Notably useful tools/weapons/items. \u00b6 -Tazers: stun for a short period, useful for getting into baton range -Batons: stun for a very long period (unless they are the collapsable baton!), enough for handcuffs. -Fire extinguishers: cover a large area in slippery water -Flashs: blindness and stun -handcuffs: see handcuffs under \"various maladies\" -magboots: prevent slipping, but slow you down. -banna peels/clown pda/similar items: slip when stepped on -crowbar: not a very good weapon, source for floor tiles -floor tiles: effective and super cheap throwing weapons. -Lit welders, hatchets, toolboxes: effective and easy to acquire melee weapons Armour \u00b6 Unlike weaponry, armour is rather simple, cutting damage by a certain percentage from certain sources. Vests, helmets, coats \u00b6 Within unitystation, there are three main types of armour generally available to crew members. Bulletproof, standard, and riot gear. These come with matching helmets, and each are good at dealing with specific types of damage. Bulletproof gear will dampen the damage dealt by bullets, but is bad against lasers, and garbage against melee weaponry. The opposite is true of the riot armour, which excells against melee, but suffers against bullets. Standard vest offer an intermediary between the two. Other, rarer, items can offer similar protection. for instance, the captains vest, HoS' coat, wardens vest, and the many aesthetic variants of the other vests all offer protection. Hardsuits \u00b6 Dont be fooled by their looks, most hardsuits are a FAR worse choice than other armour when it comes to combat. Ignoring that (on the station) only the sec and captain suits have armour values anywhere comperable to a vest, hardsuits slow you down greatly, meaning you are less able to escape or chase down others and more predictable. Their main usage is simply to let you go into space or breached regions to catch anyone in them. The one exception is the hardsuits used by nuclear operatives, which do not slow down the wearer and have great armour values. Acquiring gear \u00b6 All the gear in the world cant help you if you dont actually possess it. To this end there are many things you can do to acquire it. Following are some ideas. - Buy/Bribe for it (it is a social game, after all) - Utilize a favor or friend - Acquire it through legitimate means (taking a tazer as sec , for instance) - stealing it with or without a disguise - killing or mugging the person who has it - other strategies that can be found in the guide to access Fighting \u00b6 Combat in unitystation is fundamentally based in knowledge, gear, and planning. Raw reflexive skill plays a part, but the victor in a fight is most often the one who strikes first and stacks the most advantages while reducing those of the opponent, meaning it is almost always better to wait and prepare if you can, rather than rushing in. Planning \u00b6 A good plan is a great way of ensuring that you win a fight. If you go in prepared, equipped, and ready, against someone who is unaware or still plotting, you will have an enormous advantage. Likewise, if someone ambushes or otherwise springs a plot against you, your best choice is to flee and plan your own defense. There are many things that can be considered while planning, or when figuring things out on the fly, such as equipment, access, enviornment, relation, behaviour and your own skill. Equipment \u00b6 While equipment itself is covered above, planning how to use it is another thing entirely. When planning, you should consider what you have onhand formost, such as stunning tools or ways to access more hidden areas if you need to escape. If your plan require a specific item, it is often better to consider an alternate route than acquire the item if it poses a risk. You should also take into account what your opponent has, if at all possible. If they are wearing riot armour for instance, bring a gun, if they have their own, wear a bulletproof vest. Opponents without dedicated weapons or armour are easy prey, meaning if you can ambush them without equipment or get someone to remove theirs, it is worthwhile to attack even if you do not have a set plan in mind. Access \u00b6 something that is difficult to determine but very helpful to know is the access level of the person you are fighting as well as your own, and how they stack up. If you dont take this into account, you may end up setting up ambushes that cant be tripped and run into areas they can still hunt you down in. Having higher amounts of access opens up easier access to equipment aswell as escape routes, while having low access oftentimes limits you to open and exposed areas with little gear. If you are fighting someone with more access, it is best to stage an ambush, especilly in a region they feel safe, so that you can kill them before they can bring their equipment to bear or escape. On the flipside, when fighting someone with lower access, it is often more time-efficient to corral them into corners and chase them down, utilizing your superior access to use shortcuts and close the gap. If they somehow manage to gain the upper hand, you can escape into a region they cannot enter. Enviornment \u00b6 If you plan on fighitng in a particular location, it is helpful to know how it is layed out, and any maluses affecting the area. When fighting in space, for instance, you should plan ahead by bringing neccesary supplies to spacewalk, aswell as account for the lack of gravity. Tight regions with many corners, like maint, are great for melee ambushes, while more open areas such as hallways lend themselves well to gunfights. Other things you should account for include visibility, ease of escape, possible reinforcements, and hazards. It should be noted that you can always change the enviornment itself to suit you. Atmos techs can easily start fires, anyone can break windows to space, and anyone (but especilly engineers) can build new structures. Relations \u00b6 Taking into account your targets relation is really useful for surprise attacks and ambushes, and is very simple. If your target trusts you, and is friendly with you, you can very easily lure them into an isolated room where you can perform your evil deed (no, not that one, get your mind out of the gutter). Knowing who the target considers his friends is also useful for predicting what possible reinforcements may arrive or tag along with them, for whom you can now plan. Behaviour \u00b6 Knowing how someone behaves is similarly great for setting up surprise attacks, for obvious reasons, but also plays a large role in more open combat. If you know that someone is aware they are less important, say, an assistant, they may be willing to take greater risks, or even suicide attacks, to try and off you. On the flipside captains and other heads tend to run to security at the first sign of trouble, so you should prepare for a chase. You may even be ignored by some in favor of pursuing a more important objective, such as Nuke ops looting a disk or someone attempting to call the shuttle. Understanding how someone will react is something that comes with time, though reading the pages for the roles themselves can lend you an idea. Skill \u00b6 Finally, you should gauge your own skill against your opponents. If you are equally prepared, but they have played for ages, its probably best not to touch them. On the flipside, if your experienced, you can probably afford to get into fights with less thinking and preperation, even though its not reccomended. Skill is not an enormous factor, so dont be afraid to ambush the 1000 hour greyshirt if you feel you are prepared. Movement \u00b6 Something that plays a large factor into your survivability during a fight is your movement. skilled movement reduced the windows your opponent has to attack you, and lets you engage in favourable situations, while also allowing for easier escapes and an easier time catching others. If you intend on getting into fights, you are probably best off avoiding anything that can reduce your movement speed, such as hardsuits or magboots. Open combat \u00b6 How you approach open combat movement wise differs depending on what weapons you are equipped with. In all cases, it is best to remain further away, but in range, until you intend to attack. Melee vs Melee: Stay a tile or two away, when ready, charge at your opponent, rapidly clicking infront of you on their predicted position. when you get a hit in, retreat back. To trade blows (if you are better equipped) shuffle left and right close to your opponent, attacking constantly. Melee vs firearms: Not reccomended, for very obvious reasons. The person with a gun can damage you from a distance, so staying further away wont work. Attempt to close the gap by dodging rounds, and dont attempt to chase them if they begin to kite you. DO chase them if you are following them from a single tile behind. If you can bait them into following you, use a corner to force them into close range. Break off and retreat often, and attack unpredictably. Preferably fight in an enclosed area. Firearms vs Melee: stay far from the other opponent, when chasing them across a corner, curve wide. try to bait them into following you, so that you can kite them. A quick burst from most guns is typically enough to end any would-be jack the ripper. Firearms vs Firearms: Depends on the weapon in question. Weapons like the shotgun or uzi, which dont do well at long range, should be treated almost like melee weapons, while if you are weilding one more akin to a rifle, you should keep as much distance between you and your opponent as possible. Try to have your opponent chase you, and not the other way around. Attack unpredictably, and use lockers/corners for surprise attacks. Never fight someone who is much better equipped if you intend to live. Chasing \u00b6 People dont like becoming corpses, and for this reason many of them will choose to flee instead of fighting you. In these situations, it is helpful to know how to disable your opponent. When you are chasing someone you are entirely on the back foot. They can slip or mislead you while you have no recourse save firearms. There are however a few things you can do to raise your odds of success. Knowing when to slow down or dodge to avoid slips is critical to hunting someone down, as a single slip can mean game over. If you are equipped with magboots, you can disregard this, though you will be slower overall. If someone escapes out of sight, follow their trail of open doors. If the trail stops be sure to stop and look around for lockers where they could have hidden and search them. High ROF weapons such as smgs are great when taking down someone on the run, as you can simply out-spray their ability to dodge bullets. Disabler bolts are similarly good, as they can bring someone close enough to be shot with a tazer round. being chased \u00b6 Oftentimes you will be caught on the backfoot and forced to flee, or perhaps do so intentionally to bait an opponent into a trap, in both situations it is helpful to know a few tricks to gain the advantage. If you are looking to lose or disable your opponent quickly, slipping them is a good way to do so. Drop a bannana peel when they are directly behind, or use an extinguisher, and watch as they collapse on the floor, either letting you run off until you are hoplessly far away to be caught or allowing you to turn them into swiss cheese with your own weapons (or theirs! Remember, you can loot them). But this is not always possible, or feasable. the person chasing you may simply be equipped with magboots or be skilled enough to avoid your techniques. In these situations, you should try and run on the inner side of the hall towards and doors you plan to enter. Corners are useful for breaking up lines of sight, while intersections will make your pursuer choose between routes. If you are far enough ahead, be sure to open doors to fool your pursuers into going down incorrect paths. Should this fail, you can choose to hide, typically in a locker, or escape into an area your pursuer cannot access or doesnt want to enter (such as space). Groups \u00b6 Fighting as a cohesive group is very difficult in unitystation, but is also very rewarding, and practically necessary for antagonists such as nuke ops. If your opponent is a group, cohesive or not, there are ways to fight them, though they may be risky. Fighting as a tight group \u00b6 Fighting in a cohesive group gives the group a MASSIVE advantage over any Rambo, with very few disadvantages. People in the group are less likely to end up dead, as any injuries can be dealt with while others lay down covering fire. The added firepower is also a great bonus, a man with a taser and e-sword may be an extremely deadly threat, but not to 3 guys with their own weapons. If you wish to fight in a cohesive group, good luck, they are very difficult to form from ordinary crew. If you are a security officer or nuke op however, you can be shoved into one by your superiors or start in a group. One thing typically needed for a cohesive group is an involved leader. In secs case, this is typically the HoS, due to his rank. in nuke op squads or militias however, it may be difficult to find a leader, and the group will start to rapidly lose cohesiveness without one. I have personally seen many nuke ops lose simply because their team split apart and drifted from a lack of leadership. Fighting as a spread out group \u00b6 Fighting while spread out is the typical course for non-emergency period security as well as rebels. In this non-cohesive form, the group your in is more prone to take losses, but assuming everyone is competent , is also capable of inflicting far more damage and covering more ground. The fact that each individual in a spread out group needs combat competence is the reason security so often falls to the all consuming entropic force that is the grey tide, because if one link in security doesn't work, thats an unstopped crime, which leads other to more crime, which piles up and piles up until the station is slagged. Spread out groups can form sporadically and with varying degrees of focus. Assistants, as an example can vary widely from the usual random shenanigans, to the razor focused tunguska revolt . Fighting groups \u00b6 Fighting groups can take two routes, depending on the form of the group. a rarer third route is available if you have a group yourself, however. Fighting a clumped up together group as a lone person is HARD, simply due to the fact that there are more people. One of the best things you can do to give yourself an advantage is to simply spread the group out. a grenade or other explosive will force a group to split up somewhat, allowing you to pick off a member or two. If they are in a tight space with limited exits, a grenade can spell death for the entire group, making them incredibly powerful. In tight groups, people may split off momentarily to deal with injured or other small tasks. if you've only got single target weapons, this is a great time to strike. If the person you find is a doctor of the team tending to an injured person, shoot the injured person. this will often lend you a free kill, and make the doctor either have to leave them dead or drag them to cloning, the latter giving you the opportunity to take them down as well. Fighting melee against tight groups is typically suicide, and not recommended. Fighting spread out groups is far, far easier than fighting a tight group. if youre fighting a spread out group, treat every person you fight as someone peeled off from a tight group, and use the same tactics discussed above for dealing with them. in this case, a quick melee attack can be viable, unlike with tight groups. Fighting groups with your own groups can go a few ways. Spread out vs Spread out is a toss up, and typically decided by a few robust players. Tight vs Tight typically turns into a bloodbath where nobody wins. Tight vs spread out will nearly always result in the tight group winning. Aftermath \u00b6 Well, you killed someone, or a lot of people. Turns out, killing people can have repercussions. There are typically three routes you can go down, with varying degrees of legality and possibility for revenge. Taking responsibility \u00b6 You see that fella you killed? time to unkill him. This is the best way to avoid the wrath of sec , the guy you killed and any admins, though it isnt a good option for when you need them dead for your employers and may be impossible to do depending on how wanted you are already. The best case scenario is dragging them to cloning yourself, second best is leaving them outside medbay, and third best is just dragging them out into the hall and leaving them there for someone else to clone. The null outcome \u00b6 Simply dont touch the body after your done. This can be taken as a sign of mercy, incompetence, or mocking, depending on the whims of the person you killed. It wont let you avoid the wrath of sec , and can leave the guy you killed mad, but it can be enough to make admins brush it aside, so long as you had reason to kill them in the first place. Definitely not the best option, but sometimes necessary, especially if your on the run already. FINISH HIM \u00b6 The least legal option, by far, the one most likely to leave both the guy you killed and any watching admins mad, but one that can leave the least consequences if pulled off correctly. This option, for obvious reasons, is not a good choice for most interactions for non antags (other than say, gibbing a nuke op), but is excellent for anyone looking to cover their tracks and make sure the person they killed doesn't come back to bite them later down the line. Simply take a knife and cut them up, or toss their body into the void of space. Shoving them in an obscure locker may work, but runs the risk of them being found later. Getting Better \u00b6 Even if you read this page a thousand times, without practice your still going to get your ass beat. the best way to learn to fight in game is to simply fight. stage ragecage matches, play sec , be an antag , just don't get mad when your tossed in a cell to rot or turned into swiss cheese by gunfire.

If used on another player, they have a very good chance to drop their weapon, which you can then pick up, and possibly use (note, some guns are locked by id-based firing pins). If you absolutely must fight someone who is equipped, and are unarmed, DONT use the harm intent. use the disarm intent and use their own weapons against them. This also works in reverse, dont get in melee range if you have a gun, as you will likely get disarmed and lit up with your own gun. While you cant avoid getting in melee range if your using a melee weapon, you can minimize the risk of being disarmed by spending as little time in melee range as possible (in open combat) and instead using Hit-and-Retreat methods, or by surprising/ambushing your foe to (hopefully) chop them up before they react. Disarm doesnt stop there, though. Each individual disarm has a small chance to knock over the person being disarmed. While knocked down, people are stunned, and cannot shoot or melee back against attacks. The time given by a disarm knockdown is NOT enough to handcuff people, dont make the mistake of coming close to an angry man with a gun with only one free hand of your own. When someone is knocked down, if you are very quick, you can loot a few items from them. This can be anything on their person, from backpacks, to hidden guns, to their ID.

It can be slowed with CPR (help intent on downed critical person) and is best healed by getting somewhere one can breathe, or by healing to take a person out of a critical state.

You should also take into account what your opponent has, if at all possible. If they are wearing riot armour for instance, bring a gun, if they have their own, wear a bulletproof vest.

Having higher amounts of access opens up easier access to equipment aswell as escape routes, while having low access oftentimes limits you to open and exposed areas with little gear. If you are fighting someone with more access, it is best to stage an ambush, especilly in a region they feel safe, so that you can kill them before they can bring their equipment to bear or escape. On the flipside, when fighting someone with lower access, it is often more time-efficient to corral them into corners and chase them down, utilizing your superior access to use shortcuts and close the gap.

In all cases, it is best to remain further away, but in range, until you intend to attack. Melee vs Melee: Stay a tile or two away, when ready, charge at your opponent, rapidly clicking infront of you on their predicted position. when you get a hit in, retreat back. To trade blows (if you are better equipped) shuffle left and right close to your opponent, attacking constantly. Melee vs firearms: Not reccomended, for very obvious reasons. The person with a gun can damage you from a distance, so staying further away wont work. Attempt to close the gap by dodging rounds, and dont attempt to chase them if they begin to kite you. DO chase them if you are following them from a single tile behind. If you can bait them into following you, use a corner to force them into close range. Break off and retreat often, and attack unpredictably. Preferably fight in an enclosed area. Firearms vs Melee: stay far from the other opponent, when chasing them across a corner, curve wide. try to bait them into following you, so that you can kite them. A quick burst from most guns is typically enough to end any would-be jack the ripper. Firearms vs Firearms: Depends on the weapon in question. Weapons like the shotgun or uzi, which dont do well at long range, should be treated almost like melee weapons, while if you are weilding one more akin to a rifle, you should keep as much distance between you and your opponent as possible. Try to have your opponent chase you, and not the other way around. Attack unpredictably, and use lockers/corners for surprise attacks.

Knowing when to slow down or dodge to avoid slips is critical to hunting someone down, as a single slip can mean game over. If you are equipped with magboots, you can disregard this, though you will be slower overall. If someone escapes out of sight, follow their trail of open doors. If the trail stops be sure to stop and look around for lockers where they could have hidden and search them. High ROF weapons such as smgs are great when taking down someone on the run, as you can simply out-spray their ability to dodge bullets.

Drop a bannana peel when they are directly behind, or use an extinguisher, and watch as they collapse on the floor, either letting you run off until you are hoplessly far away to be caught or allowing you to turn them into swiss cheese with your own weapons (or theirs! Remember, you can loot them). But this is not always possible, or feasable. the person chasing you may simply be equipped with magboots or be skilled enough to avoid your techniques. In these situations, you should try and run on the inner side of the hall towards and doors you plan to enter. Corners are useful for breaking up lines of sight, while intersections will make your pursuer choose between routes. If you are far enough ahead, be sure to open doors to fool your pursuers into going down incorrect paths.

In secs case, this is typically the HoS, due to his rank. in nuke op squads or militias however, it may be difficult to find a leader, and the group will start to rapidly lose cohesiveness without one.

Fighting a clumped up together group as a lone person is HARD, simply due to the fact that there are more people. One of the best things you can do to give yourself an advantage is to simply spread the group out. a grenade or other explosive will force a group to split up somewhat, allowing you to pick off a member or two. If they are in a tight space with limited exits, a grenade can spell death for the entire group, making them incredibly powerful. In tight groups, people may split off momentarily to deal with injured or other small tasks. if you've only got single target weapons, this is a great time to strike. If the person you find is a doctor of the team tending to an injured person, shoot the injured person. this will often lend you a free kill, and make the doctor either have to leave them dead or drag them to cloning, the latter giving you the opportunity to take them down as well. Fighting melee against tight groups is typically suicide, and not recommended. Fighting spread out groups is far, far easier than fighting a tight group. if youre fighting a spread out group, treat every person you fight as someone peeled off from a tight group, and use the same tactics discussed above for dealing with them. in this case, a quick melee attack can be viable, unlike with tight groups. Fighting groups with your own groups can go a few ways. Spread out vs Spread out is a toss up, and typically decided by a few robust players.

In effect, the shuttles act like moving rooms (or sets of rooms), that can be boarded and (outside special exceptions) manually piloted. objects within the shuttle are fully interactable, and can be used midflight, and people can travel across the shuttle while it is moving. The downside to this full flyability and interactivity is that large shuttles, with many moving tiles, can create large amounts of lag. How they work \u00b6 The most important part of a shuttle is its piloting console, a shuttle can fly if its walls are torn apart and it has a single engine left, but without the console it will become dead in the water, or worse, continue moving infinitely. If the console is emagged, it will display the locations of people (and the disk) on the console map and disable shuttle safeties. Most shuttles are equipped with collision sensors, if a sensor detects a blocked tile directly infront of it, it will instantly stop the shuttle and prevent the collision, these are turned off if the shuttle console is emagged, which will allow for shuttle ramming. some shuttles are equipped with RCS systems, responsible for translating the shuttle left and right when in action, these are optional and not required to fly, but are helpful for docking. shuttles require fuel to function, in particular, plasma, canisters of which must be wrenched in place over fuel connectors to supply the shuttle engines. The only things actually needed for a shuttles successful operation is a console, an engine, and fuel. Yes, walls are optional. Ace pilot \u00b6 If the shuttle is capeable of flying, it can be flown from the shuttle console. When interacted with it will show a popup screen displaying a map, turn controls, an RCS button, a button to start/stop the shuttle, and a thrust slider. The map normally displays the locations of other shuttles, asteroids, and the station origin. If the console is emagged it will additionally show the locations of players and the nuke disk. Do note the map only displays the origin/center of the station, and NOT its outer bounds, if you see it ANYWHERE on the map it is best to slow down unless you are fully intent on commiting space jihad. The turn controls rotate the shuttle 90 degrees left or right when used, and the thrust slider changes how fast the shuttle moves forward, do note that shuttles cannot move backwards using ordinary engine setups. When the RCS button is used, it will toggle RCS, which will make the turn buttons translate the shuttle left or right instead of turning it, good for docking. Types of shuttles \u00b6 there are a few \"types\" of shuttle in unitystation, which while not differing in control can vary in size, danger, and operation. Small shuttles \u00b6 These are shuttles like the personal shuttles, often found attached to various departments or in a bay. they are the most common, and cannot fit many occupants, but their small size means that they are able to fit in more places just near the station than other larger shuttles. The fact that the shuttles are self powering, and these small shuttles are rarely missed, makes them a perfect getaway, secret lair, or electronic warfare center if you have a spacesuit and materials. A lesser known small shuttle is the centcom shuttle, tucked away in the top right of the centcom station. the fact that centcom is normally only visited seconds before the round ends and is very far away makes it practically unused and useless, in theory it could be used for centcom boarding parties. Large shuttles \u00b6 Large shuttles are less common, and many large shuttles only appear in certain gamemodes or maps. They are just as fast as small shuttles (owing to more engines), but cannot fit in as many places and typically require extensive docks to hold them. on some maps, mining will have access to a large mining shuttle capeable of holding and supporting the entire mining team, equipped with a small medbay and storage. Nuke ops have the syndicate shuttle, a bulky and well armoured shuttle with a large and well stocked medbay and armoury, aswell as a far larger than normal bridge and actual airlocks instead of single doors which allow for air conservation even when not docked, for stealthy station boarding. A lesser known large shuttle is the wizards shuttle, which is very large and contains all manner of strange rooms. the front of the ship contains a piloting console which is seldom used, as wizards dont have to fly and can just teleport to the station. Special shuttles \u00b6 There also exist special shuttles, shuttles that dont obey normal shuttle operation, these are the cargo shuttle, arrivals shuttle, and escape shuttle. The cargo shuttle does not start with a shuttle console, and is instead piloted automatically when it recives orders to come to or leave cargo. interestingly, it does not actually go anywhere, instead spending some time far away from the station before magically returning with requested goods onboard. If it is equipped with a console, be VERY careful, as the shuttle is faster than normal and has no collision sensors, making it a perfect way to accidentally (or purpousefully) carve a hole into the station and die in a crash. It is practically invincible, and if piloted into asteroids or the station will have no problem carving directly through them. The arrivals shuttle is interesting, because despite having a shuttle matrix, it cannot actually be flown, only turned. it is also where late-join players will appear. The escape shuttle is by FAR the fastest shuttle, and similarly to the cargo shuttle is piloted automaticallt to and from the station during evacuation. It is goddamn immortal, and though it can take damage it will not stop, cleanly carving through asteroids in its path. If it is equipped with a console, by manually building one, its incredible speed and armour make it a perfect projectile, and the shuttle can cleanly tear through the entire station, and then sail through the other side. Danger Zone \u00b6 Shuttles pose a few dangers, namely, when crashed they will destroy tiles, kill those directly impacted, and kill those onboard if the collision was fast enough. The onboard plasma canister can start fires if tampered with (rarely), and it being always adjacent to space means that any hull breach or nick can quickly kill unsuited crew. if a shuttle runs out of fuel, it becomes stuck, and if the console is destroyed while it is flying it will continue to fly in the direction it was going until fuel runs out or the console is rebuilt.","title":"Guide to Flying"},{"location":"Guides/General%20guides/Guide-to-Flying/#guide-to-flying","text":"","title":"Guide to Flying"},{"location":"Guides/General%20guides/Guide-to-Flying/#overview","text":"This guide will cover what shuttles are, shuttle operation, how to fly shuttles, the quirks of each \"type\" of shuttle, and the dangers shuttles can pose.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"Guides/General%20guides/Guide-to-Flying/#what-is-a-shuttle","text":"Unlike Byond SS13, where shuttles must teleport between destinations or perform Z-Level trickery to fake flight, shuttles in unitystation are fully flyable and much more responsive.

Nuke ops have the syndicate shuttle, a bulky and well armoured shuttle with a large and well stocked medbay and armoury, aswell as a far larger than normal bridge and actual airlocks instead of single doors which allow for air conservation even when not docked, for stealthy station boarding. A lesser known large shuttle is the wizards shuttle, which is very large and contains all manner of strange rooms. the front of the ship contains a piloting console which is seldom used, as wizards dont have to fly and can just teleport to the station.","title":"Large shuttles"},{"location":"Guides/General%20guides/Guide-to-Flying/#special-shuttles","text":"There also exist special shuttles, shuttles that dont obey normal shuttle operation, these are the cargo shuttle, arrivals shuttle, and escape shuttle. The cargo shuttle does not start with a shuttle console, and is instead piloted automatically when it recives orders to come to or leave cargo. interestingly, it does not actually go anywhere, instead spending some time far away from the station before magically returning with requested goods onboard. If it is equipped with a console, be VERY careful, as the shuttle is faster than normal and has no collision sensors, making it a perfect way to accidentally (or purpousefully) carve a hole into the station and die in a crash. It is practically invincible, and if piloted into asteroids or the station will have no problem carving directly through them. The arrivals shuttle is interesting, because despite having a shuttle matrix, it cannot actually be flown, only turned. it is also where late-join players will appear. The escape shuttle is by FAR the fastest shuttle, and similarly to the cargo shuttle is piloted automaticallt to and from the station during evacuation. It is goddamn immortal, and though it can take damage it will not stop, cleanly carving through asteroids in its path. If it is equipped with a console, by manually building one, its incredible speed and armour make it a perfect projectile, and the shuttle can cleanly tear through the entire station, and then sail through the other side.","title":"Special shuttles"},{"location":"Guides/General%20guides/Guide-to-Flying/#danger-zone","text":"Shuttles pose a few dangers, namely, when crashed they will destroy tiles, kill those directly impacted, and kill those onboard if the collision was fast enough. The onboard plasma canister can start fires if tampered with (rarely), and it being always adjacent to space means that any hull breach or nick can quickly kill unsuited crew. if a shuttle runs out of fuel, it becomes stuck, and if the console is destroyed while it is flying it will continue to fly in the direction it was going until fuel runs out or the console is rebuilt.","title":"Danger Zone"},{"location":"Guides/General%20guides/Guide-to-Player-Species/","text":"Guide to Player Species \u00b6 During your time on station you may find yourself face to face (or face to mirror) with the not quite human.

Death early on will force you into a ghost state where you watch over the round until someone clones you (there is a way to keep playing after death currently under implementation). But unlike Space Station 13, you can't respawn in anyway. If you are new to Unitystation here is a small list for you so you can try to not die instantly. How not to die instantly \u00b6 1) To not die you need to know the controls - W A S D for walking and mouse for interacting. You have two hands to pickup things with, you can swap between them with the X key. Using actual hands to move stuff arround can be confusing at first, but with some practice it gets done. See intents to find out how to interact with things and beings. 1a) Other controls: Q to drop the thing you are currently holding on the ground, Z to \"activate\" the item you are holding (it can also be done by clicking the item), R to throw the item you are holding far away, Ctrl + Click to drag something (a body or locker usually), and Shift + Click to see a description on something or someone. 1b) Talk controls: T to talk normally, Y to radio chat 2) Eat. Food can be found at the cafeteria, if food cannot be found then find a knife, hunt some prey (animals and humans work, but unless you want to get arrested use animals) and butcher it, the meat can then be used for a variety of foods . 3) If the door you try to open flashed yellow you probably should not go through it, because it's depressurized on the other side. 4) If you do need to walk through that door then get a heavy duty suit and preferably mag boots, and an oxygen supply, that requires a mask and an oxygen tank in your hot bar, to enable the supply click the icon on the right. 5) Do the \"tutorial\". The \"tutorial\" step of every round is opening your backpack, getting out the box in your backpack, putting on the oxygen mask from the box to your face slot, getting the oxygen bottle out, putting it on your pocket and enabling the oxygen supply. 6) Learn to do your role, to do so look on the bottom of the main page , it contains a guide on (almost) every role in the game. 7) Don't do crimes, unless you want to be brigged, and possibility abused, learn the Space Law if you want to, it is your best weapon against shitcurity . 8) If you get spaced (the act of being thrown out into space by pressure) shoot something or throw anything and everything you can in the direction you're flying, that will hopefully, make you fly the other way. Unless you have a spacesuit, you're still going to die, but you're more likely to be found by your crew mates. Also an extinguisher works for this, remember the wall-e movie? 9) If there is a Xenomorph invasion, Syndies , or too much chaos on board: 9a) If you are armed and robust, you can go at em (not recomended for newbies, but who cares), however, be careful and try to never go on your own. 9b) If you are not armed or not robust then run away, cower behind sec and hide in a locker, or get to the escape shuttle or some other safe place. You can also call atention to the thing that you saw through the radio (open the chat and click the radio icon) 10) Learn to build in case you need to, and more importantly to destroy (same guide) if you are trapped. 11) You should try to keep a tool-stacked tool-belt, med-kit, a light and some food at all times in your person. I prefer six cutlets, but to each their own. 12) You are expected to know how to role play to a certain extent, use these role play abbreviations . To roleplay means that you can ask for help in game as your character instead of using the mentor help button. 13) Try not to pick antagonists (antags) the first times you play, at least until you are familiar with the controls. If you want to start being antag, try being a traitor , and remember that as one you are allowed to get away with many war crimes, but try to only make life hell for your target, please. 14) Do not pick any security role untill you have at least some idea of how the combat system works (you are \"robust\" enough). If you're a security officer , please don't make power plays, it ruins the other's experience and gives you temporary euphoria, with regret afterwards. 15) If you're injured you should go to medical to get treated or treat yourself. You can see how bad you are doing by checking the color of your body in the ui. 16) If the floor is wet, press C to walk. You will move more slowly, but you wont slip and fall into the floor. You wont slip at all if you are wearing the janitors boots however. 17) And most importantly, talk. UnityStation is, in fact, a chating game, so experiment with the chat as much as you can before trying anything else.

You'll also apply medication if you're holding any. In addition, if you have your intent on Help, and walk into someone who also has their intent on Help, you'll swap places with each other (instead of just pushing them in the drection you're moving). Be careful' - if you have an item in your hand that isn't designed to help someone, you'll still attack them with it! Disarm Intent \u00b6 The 'Disarm intent is used to nonlethally disarm and incapacitate people. If you click on someone with an empty hand while on Disarm, you'll shove' them. It's also important to note that 'these actions only work if you're clicking on the target with an empty hand', just as with all intents. Grab Intent \u00b6 The 'Grab intent allows you to, as it says, grab people. Grabbing someone with Grab intent works differently from control-clicking. If you click on someone with an empty hand, you'll have a passive grab, which makes you pull people. You stop dragging the same way you stop pulling. While on passive grab, clicking on the person once more upgrades it to an aggressive' grab. The target can press \"resist\" to try to escape from an aggressive or above grab level. Harm Intent \u00b6 The 'Harm' intent will harm. On standing targets you will attempt to punch them. The chance to miss a punch increases the more stamina and brute damage you have. Punching has a chance to knockdown the target. The more brute and stamina damage the target has, the longer the target will be knocked down. If using harm intent on prone targets you will kick them.

Space Law applies to all ranks and positions on station, from the lowliest Assistant to the highest Captain, all are equal under the eyes of the Law and ultimately answer to her. The rules and regulations herein are not absolutes, instead they exist to serve mainly as guidelines for the law and order of the dynamic situations that exist for stations on the frontiers of space, as such some leeway is permitted. Crime Codes Quick Reference \u00b6 Use this to quickly find the Crime Code Numbers. Crime codes are made up of Category Codes (_xx), which are a collection of similar crimes on a line for ease of use, prefixed by the Severity Number (X__). ode 1XX - Minor 2XX - Medium 3XX - Major 4XX - Capital 01 Resisting Arrest Assault Assault, Deadly Weapon Murder 02 Pickpocketing Assault, Officer Assault, Sexual 03 Drug Distribution Manslaughter Attempted Murder 04 Possession, Drugs Possession, Weapons Possession, Restricted Weapons 05 Possession, Explosives 06 Indecent Exposure Rioting Inciting a Riot Mutiny 07 Vandalism Workplace Hazard Sabotage Grand Sabotage 08 Petty Theft Theft Grand Theft 09 Trespass Major Trespass 10 Breaking and Entry B&E Restricted 11 Insubordination Dereliction Enemy of the Corp Interpretation of the Law \u00b6 A good working knowledge of Space Law is important for any person on the station. It can be the difference between a shiny pair of handcuffs and sipping Gargle Blasters in the bar. More in depth interpretations of space law are required for such positions as the Lawyer, Warden, HoP, and the HoS. While it is unlikely that the officers will listen particularly closely to your protestations, it may be enough to lighten your sentence and avoid ill treatment by security. For certain crimes, the accused's intent is important. The difference between Assault and Attempted Murder can be very hard to ascertain, and, when in doubt, you should default to the less serious crime. It is important to note though, that Assault and Attempted Murder are mutually exclusive. You cannot be charged with Assault and Attempted Murder from the same crime as the intent of each is different. Likewise, 'Assault With a Deadly Weapon' and 'Assaulting an Officer' are also crimes that exclude others. Pay careful attention to the requirements of each law and select the one that best fits the crime when deciding sentence. In the case of violent crimes (Assault, Manslaughter, Attempted Murder and Murder), and theft (Petty Theft, Pick-Pocketing, Theft, and Grand Theft) take only the most severe. A single incident has a single sentence, so if, for instance, the prisoner took three items off of someone, this is a single count of pick-pocketing, if they pick-pocketed two people this would be two separate counts of pick-pocketing, and so on. Aiding a criminal makes you an accomplice; you can be charged with the same crime as the person you aided. Brig Procedures Standard Operational Procedures for brigging are as follows: Take the prisoner to the brig and inform the Warden of their crimes so their Security Record may be updated. Take the prisoner to a brig cell, set the time and activate the timer. Enter the cell with the prisoner in tow, open the cell locker and hold the prisoner over it. Empty their pockets and remove their gloves, backpacks, tool belt, gas masks, and any flash resistant equipment such as Sunglasses, Welding Masks/Goggles, Space Helmets, etc. Buckle the prisoner to the bed. Search the items removed and be sure to check the internals box in their backpack. Confiscate any contraband and/or stolen items, as well as any tools that may be used for future crimes. These are to be placed in evidence, not left on the brig floor or your personal use , until they can be returned to their rightful owners. Close the locker and lock it . Stun the prisoner, remove their cuffs, stun them again, pick up the cuffs then leave the cell. Modify their brig sentence for additional offences or good behavior, if applicable. Do NOT fully strip the prisoner unless they have earned a permanent sentence. In the event of a sentence exceeding the 10 minute limit of the timer inform the Warden so he may add the rest of the time later. In the instance of prisoners that have earned Labor Camp duty, you must dress them in orange overalls and assign them targets, based on their sentence, by getting a prison ID, putting it in a Prisoner Management Console, assigning their quota (with a conversion rate of 100 points per minute otherwise served in the brig) and then giving them the ID as you ship them to the Labor Camp. There are more details on this procedure at Labor Camp.** NOTE: In the current revision of TG, Mineral spawn is heavily reduced in the gulag area. If you plan on using the gulag for several incidences [meaning the floors are already mined so people can't mine the floors for glass], you should use a lower conversion rate. The Warden or Head of Security are responsible for placing prisoners and in permanent confinement. Permanent Prisoners are to be completely stripped of their belongings, which are to be held in either evidence or a prison locker. The prisoner is to be dressed in an Orange Prison Jumpsuit and Shoes, which are found in the prison lockers. Permanent Prisoners are not permitted to possess any personal belongings whilst they are incarcerated in the Prison Wing . The Labor Camp can also be used to hold Permanent Prisoners. Simply do not issue a prisoner ID when transferring them to the camp. Legal Representation and Trials \u00b6 Prisoners are permitted to seek legal representation however you are under no obligation to provide or allow this. Lawyers, and by extension the Head of Personnel, exist to serve as a guiding hand and the voice of reason within the judicial process, however they have zero authority over the brig, security personnel, prisoners, or sentencing. The Lawyer's security headset is a privilege not a right. Security personnel are under no requirement to listen to them and security channel abuse is to result in that privilege being revoked. If the lawyer continuously acts as a disruptive influence Security are fully permitted to confiscate their access, remove them from the brig and bar their future access to it. In instances where a conflict of opinion arises over the sentence of a prisoner the chain of command must be followed. This goes, from top to bottom: Captain > Head of Security > Warden > Sec Officer / Detective. Trials are not to be performed for Timed Sentences. This is mainly for the benefit of the accused as trials will often run many times the length of the actual sentence. Trials may be performed for Capital Crimes and Permanent Detention, however there is no requirement to hold them. Forensic Evidence, Witness Testimony, or Confessions are all that is required for the Head of Security, Warden or Captain to authorize their sentence. In cases where the Death Penalty is desired but the Captain or Acting-Captain is unable or unwilling to authorize the execution a trial is required to authorise the death penalty. Use of Deadly Force \u00b6 As a member of the stations Security force you are one of the best armed and protected people on the station, equipped with the almost latest in non-lethal takedown technology. It is for this reason that the situations that warrant the use of Deadly Force are few and far between, in the grand majority of circumstances you will be expected to use your stun weapons, which indeed are many times more effective than lethal options, to diffuse a situation. There are a few circumstances where deadly force is permissible: Code Red Situation - situations which would warrant a Code Red, such as: full blown mutinies, hostile boarding parties, and Space Wizards automatically authorise lethal force. Note: The Alert Status is not required to be elevated to Code Red as in most of these scenarios the Chain of Command will be too damaged or otherwise occupied to raise the Alert Level. Non-Lethal Weapons Ineffective - certain targets are impervious to NLWs, such as Mechs, Xenomorphs, Borgs, and Hulks. Lethal force may be used against these targets if they prove hostile. Severe Personal Risk - sometimes getting close enough to a target to slap the cuffs on will create significant personal risk to the Officer. Deadly force from range is recommended to subdue Wizards and Changelings. Criminals in hostile environments such as space, fire, or plasma leaks also fall into this category, as do criminals believed to be in possession of high explosives. Ranged lethal force is the only reasonable option in these conditions. Armed and Dangerous - if a suspect is in possession of weapons, including stun weapons, and you have reasonable suspicion that they will use these against you, lethal force is permitted. Although in the majority of cases it is still preferable to attempt to detain them non-lethally. Unauthorized personnel in the armory are considered by default to be Armed and Dangerous, maximum force is permitted to subdue such targets. Multiple Hostiles - it can be extremely difficult to detain multiple hostiles. As a last resort if you are being mobbed you may deploy your baton in a harmful manner to thin the crowd. Generally it is better to retreat and regroup than stand your ground. Additionally, in the event of an attempted prison break, Security may fire lasers through the glass. They are expected to first fire a few warning shots before unloading their weapon into the target. Minor Crimes \u00b6 All of these crimes carry a 1 minute sentence. Code Crime Description Notes 101 File:Resisting Arrest.PNG Resisting Arrest To not cooperate with an officer who attempts a proper arrest. Follow proper arrest procedure and have a legitimate cause to arrest in the first place before you brig a suspect for this. Suspects who scream bloody murder while being arrested are not cooperating. 104 File:Libertycap.png Drug Possession To possess space drugs or other narcotics by unauthorised personnel. Botanists and MedSci staff are authorised to possess drugs for purposes of their jobs and are not subject to this law so long as they are not distributing or using them for profit or recreation. 106 File:Indecent exposure.png Indecent Exposure To be intentionally and publicly unclothed. Running around the station naked. The mutual degradation of chasing a naked man down while he screams rape is only worth it on slow shifts. 107 File:Vandalism.PNG Vandalism To deliberately damage the station with malicious intent. Sentence depends on quantity of property damaged. 109 File:Trespassing.png Trespass To be in an area which a person does not have access to. This counts for general areas of the ship, and trespass in restricted areas is a more serious crime. Remember that people can either break in, sneak in, or be let in. Always check that the suspect wasn't let in to do a job by someone with access, or were given access on their ID. Trespassing and theft are often committed together; both sentences should be applied. Medium Crimes \u00b6 All of these crimes carry a 2 minute sentence or a 100 point target at the Labor Camp, optional for the suspect you are arresting. Code Crime Description Notes 201 File:Assault.png Assault To use physical force against someone without the apparent intent to kill them. Depending on the amount and kind of force used, severe instances should be elevated to attempted manslaughter or even murder. Assaults with deadly weapons are a higher crime. 202 File:Pickpocketing.png Pick-Pocketing To steal items from another's person. Remember to take the stolen items from the person and arrange for their return. Stealing an ID is the most common and most serious form of pick-pocketing. 203 File:Narcotics Distribution.PNG Narcotics Distribution To distribute narcotics and other controlled substances. Forcing or tricking someone to consume substances such as space drugs is assault. 204 weapon Possession of a Weapon To be in possession of a dangerous item that is not part of their job role. Items capable of a high level of damage, such as saws, axes, and hatchets fit into this category. Do remember that if it is an item that is part of their job they are permitted to carry it. 206 File:Rioting.PNG Rioting To partake in an unauthorised and disruptive assembly of crewmen that refuse to disperse. It is required to order the crowd to disperse, failure to disperse is the crime not the assembly. Any crimes committed during the riot are considered separate offences. 207 File:Workplace Hazard.PNG Creating a Workplace Hazard To endanger the crew or station through negligent or irresponsible, but not deliberately malicious, actions. Good examples of this crime involves accidentally causing a plasma leak, slipping hazard, accidently electrifying doors, breaking windows to space, or Security personnel not keeping their equipment secure. 208 File:Petty theft.png Petty Theft To take items from areas one does not have access to or to take items belonging to others or the station as a whole. Keeping items which are in short supply where they belong is what is important here. A doctor who takes all the surgical tools and hides them still commits theft, even though he had access. 210 File:BandE.PNG Breaking and Entry Forced entry to areas where the subject does not have access to. This counts for general areas, and breaking into restricted areas is a more serious crime. Crew can still be charged with breaking & entry even if they do not enter the area themselves. 211 File:Insubordination.PNG Insubordination To disobey a lawful direct order from one's superior officer. Charge issued by a head of staff to one of their direct subordinates. The person is usually demoted instead of incarcerated. Security is expected to assist the head in carrying out the demotion Major Crimes \u00b6 These crimes carry a service at the Labor Camp, with a 500 point target or a five minute brig sentence. Code Crime Description Notes 301 File:Assault Deadly Weapon.PNG Assault With a Deadly Weapon To use physical force, through a deadly weapon, against someone without the apparent intent to kill them. Any variety of tools, chemicals or even construction materials can inflict serious injury in short order. If the victim was especially brutalized, consider charging them with attempted murder. 302 File:Assaulting an officer.PNG Assault of an Officer To use physical force against a Department Head or member of Security without the apparent intent to kill them. Criminals who attempt to disarm or grab officers while fleeing are guilty of this, even if bare handed. Officers should refrain from using lethal means to subdue the criminal if possible. 303 File:Manslaughter.PNG Manslaughter To unintentionally kill someone through negligent, but not malicious, actions. Intent is important. Accidental deaths caused by negligent actions, such as creating workplace hazards (e.g. gas leaks), tampering with equipment, excessive force, and confinement in unsafe conditions are examples of Manslaughter. 304 Weapon Possession of a Restricted Weapon To be in possession of a restricted weapon without prior authorisation, such as: Guns, Batons, Flashes, Grenades, etc. Any item that can cause severe bodily harm or incapacitate for a significant time. The following personnel have unrestricted license to carry weapons and firearms: Captain, HoP, all Security Personnel.The Barman is permitted his double barrel shotgun loaded with beanbag rounds. Only the Captain and HoS can issue weapon permits. 305 File:Possession Explosives.PNG Possession of Explosives To be in possession of an explosive device. Scientists and Miners are permitted to possess explosives only whilst transporting them to the mining asteroid, otherwise their experimental bombs must remain within the Science department. 306 File:Inciting Riot.PNG Inciting a Riot To attempt to stir the crew into a riot Additionally to the brig time the offender will also have restrictions placed on their radio traffic and be implanted with a tracking implant. For second offences or outright instigating violent uprisings consider charging with Mutiny. 307 File:Disrupting power.png Sabotage To hinder the work of the crew or station through malicious actions. Deliberately releasing N2O, bolting doors, disabling the power network, and constructing barricades are but some of many means of sabotage. For more violent forms, see Grand Sabotage. 308 File:Theft.PNG Theft To steal restricted or dangerous items Weapons fall into this category, as do valuable items that are in limited supply such as insulated gloves, spacesuits, and jetpacks.Note that Cargo breaking open crates to illegally arm and armor themselves are guilty of theft. 309 Major pass Major Trespass Being in a restricted area without prior authorisation. This includes any Security Area, Command area (including EVA), the Engine Room, Atmos, or Toxins Research. Being in a very high security area, such as the armoury or the Captain's Quarters, is a more serious crime, and warrants a time of 10 minutes with a possible permabrigging if intent is believed to be malicious. 310 File:BE Restricted.PNG B&E of a Restricted Area This is breaking into any Security area, Command area (Bridge, EVA, Captains Quarters, Teleporter, etc.), the Engine Room, Atmos, or Toxins research. As a major crime sentences start at 5 minutes, but can be extended if security believes break in was for attempted Grand Theft or attempted Grand Sabotage (yellow gloves don't count as grand theft). 311 Dereliction Dereliction of Duty To willfully abandon an obligation that is critical to the station's continued operation. A demotion is often included in the sentence. Emphasis on the word critical: An officer taking a break is not dereliction in of itself. An officer taking a break knowing that operatives are shooting up the Captain is. Engineers who do not secure a power source at the start of the shift and heads of staff who abandon the station can also be charged. Capital Crimes \u00b6 These crimes can result in Execution, Permanent Prison Time, Permanent Labor Camp Time, or Cyborgization. Only the Captain, HoS, and Warden can authorize a Permanent Sentence. Only the Captain can authorize an Execution or Forced Cyborgization. Code Crime Description Notes 401 File:Murder.PNG Murder To maliciously kill someone. Punishment should fit the nature of both the crime and the criminal. Murder committed by temporary emotional distress, such as fear or anger, warrants lower punishments. Cyborg candidates must have brains fit to obey relevant laws. Life imprisonment is the most humane option for the insane who might malfunction as cyborgs. Unauthorised executions are classed as Murder. 402 File:Sexual Assault.PNG Sexual Assault To molest or otherwise sexually attack someone. Unconsented ERP scenes, regardless of OOC consent by all parties, is a violation of server rules, and worthy of a permanent ban . Adminhelp it if this happens to you; it's against server rules, not just station rules. 403 File:Attempted Murder.PNG Attempted Murder To use physical force against a person until that person is in a critical state with the apparent intent to kill them. Remember, if a person attempts to render first aid after the victim falls into a critical state they may not have intend to kill them. 406 File:Mutiny.PNG Mutiny To act individually, or as a group, to overthrow or subvert the established Chain of Command without lawful and legitimate cause. Mutiny is not as clear cut as it may seem, there may be a legitimate reason for their actions, such as their head of staff being utterly incompetent. This is one of the few crimes where it is recommended to always seek a third party opinion. If their actions are determined to be for the betterment of Nanotrasen consider a timed sentence or even a full pardon. 407 Compromising Station Integrity Grand Sabotage To engage in maliciously destructive actions, seriously threatening crew or station. Bombing, arson, releasing viruses, deliberately exposing areas to space, physically destroying machinery or electrifying doors all count as Grand Sabotage. 408 High value target theft Grand Theft To steal items of high value or sensitive nature. Syndicate agents frequently attempt to steal cutting-edge technology. Examples include: intelligence or research samples, the Hand Teleporter, the Captain's Antique Laser, the Captain or the HoP's ID cards, or Mechs. This is by no means a exhaustive list of items that are high value to the syndicate; when in doubt use common sense when you see certain items that are stolen that can cause massive problems throughout the station. Remember if something is locked up in a secure area it probably should not be taken without prior permission. 411 File:Antag skum.png Enemy of the Corporation To act as, or knowingly aid, an enemy of Nanotrasen. Current enemies of Nanotrasen currently include: The Syndicate (through secret agents, boarding parties, and brainwashing specialists), The Wizard Federation, The Changeling Hivemind, and The Cult of Nar'Sie.Note that this is one of the few crimes where you may summarily execute someone for if they present a significant risk to detain them.

It can be the difference between a shiny pair of handcuffs and sipping Gargle Blasters in the bar. More in depth interpretations of space law are required for such positions as the Lawyer, Warden, HoP, and the HoS. While it is unlikely that the officers will listen particularly closely to your protestations, it may be enough to lighten your sentence and avoid ill treatment by security. For certain crimes, the accused's intent is important. The difference between Assault and Attempted Murder can be very hard to ascertain, and, when in doubt, you should default to the less serious crime. It is important to note though, that Assault and Attempted Murder are mutually exclusive. You cannot be charged with Assault and Attempted Murder from the same crime as the intent of each is different. Likewise, 'Assault With a Deadly Weapon' and 'Assaulting an Officer' are also crimes that exclude others. Pay careful attention to the requirements of each law and select the one that best fits the crime when deciding sentence. In the case of violent crimes (Assault, Manslaughter, Attempted Murder and Murder), and theft (Petty Theft, Pick-Pocketing, Theft, and Grand Theft) take only the most severe. A single incident has a single sentence, so if, for instance, the prisoner took three items off of someone, this is a single count of pick-pocketing, if they pick-pocketed two people this would be two separate counts of pick-pocketing, and so on. Aiding a criminal makes you an accomplice; you can be charged with the same crime as the person you aided. Brig Procedures Standard Operational Procedures for brigging are as follows: Take the prisoner to the brig and inform the Warden of their crimes so their Security Record may be updated. Take the prisoner to a brig cell, set the time and activate the timer. Enter the cell with the prisoner in tow, open the cell locker and hold the prisoner over it. Empty their pockets and remove their gloves, backpacks, tool belt, gas masks, and any flash resistant equipment such as Sunglasses, Welding Masks/Goggles, Space Helmets, etc. Buckle the prisoner to the bed. Search the items removed and be sure to check the internals box in their backpack. Confiscate any contraband and/or stolen items, as well as any tools that may be used for future crimes. These are to be placed in evidence, not left on the brig floor or your personal use , until they can be returned to their rightful owners. Close the locker and lock it . Stun the prisoner, remove their cuffs, stun them again, pick up the cuffs then leave the cell. Modify their brig sentence for additional offences or good behavior, if applicable. Do NOT fully strip the prisoner unless they have earned a permanent sentence. In the event of a sentence exceeding the 10 minute limit of the timer inform the Warden so he may add the rest of the time later. In the instance of prisoners that have earned Labor Camp duty, you must dress them in orange overalls and assign them targets, based on their sentence, by getting a prison ID, putting it in a Prisoner Management Console, assigning their quota (with a conversion rate of 100 points per minute otherwise served in the brig) and then giving them the ID as you ship them to the Labor Camp. There are more details on this procedure at Labor Camp.** NOTE: In the current revision of TG, Mineral spawn is heavily reduced in the gulag area. If you plan on using the gulag for several incidences [meaning the floors are already mined so people can't mine the floors for glass], you should use a lower conversion rate. The Warden or Head of Security are responsible for placing prisoners and in permanent confinement. Permanent Prisoners are to be completely stripped of their belongings, which are to be held in either evidence or a prison locker. The prisoner is to be dressed in an Orange Prison Jumpsuit and Shoes, which are found in the prison lockers. Permanent Prisoners are not permitted to possess any personal belongings whilst they are incarcerated in the Prison Wing . The Labor Camp can also be used to hold Permanent Prisoners. Simply do not issue a prisoner ID when transferring them to the camp.","title":"Interpretation of the Law"},{"location":"Guides/Security%20guides/Space-Law/#legal-representation-and-trials","text":"Prisoners are permitted to seek legal representation however you are under no obligation to provide or allow this. Lawyers, and by extension the Head of Personnel, exist to serve as a guiding hand and the voice of reason within the judicial process, however they have zero authority over the brig, security personnel, prisoners, or sentencing. The Lawyer's security headset is a privilege not a right. Security personnel are under no requirement to listen to them and security channel abuse is to result in that privilege being revoked. If the lawyer continuously acts as a disruptive influence Security are fully permitted to confiscate their access, remove them from the brig and bar their future access to it. In instances where a conflict of opinion arises over the sentence of a prisoner the chain of command must be followed. This goes, from top to bottom: Captain > Head of Security > Warden > Sec Officer / Detective. Trials are not to be performed for Timed Sentences. This is mainly for the benefit of the accused as trials will often run many times the length of the actual sentence. Trials may be performed for Capital Crimes and Permanent Detention, however there is no requirement to hold them. Forensic Evidence, Witness Testimony, or Confessions are all that is required for the Head of Security, Warden or Captain to authorize their sentence. In cases where the Death Penalty is desired but the Captain or Acting-Captain is unable or unwilling to authorize the execution a trial is required to authorise the death penalty.","title":"Legal Representation and Trials"},{"location":"Guides/Security%20guides/Space-Law/#use-of-deadly-force","text":"As a member of the stations Security force you are one of the best armed and protected people on the station, equipped with the almost latest in non-lethal takedown technology. It is for this reason that the situations that warrant the use of Deadly Force are few and far between, in the grand majority of circumstances you will be expected to use your stun weapons, which indeed are many times more effective than lethal options, to diffuse a situation. There are a few circumstances where deadly force is permissible: Code Red Situation - situations which would warrant a Code Red, such as: full blown mutinies, hostile boarding parties, and Space Wizards automatically authorise lethal force. Note: The Alert Status is not required to be elevated to Code Red as in most of these scenarios the Chain of Command will be too damaged or otherwise occupied to raise the Alert Level. Non-Lethal Weapons Ineffective - certain targets are impervious to NLWs, such as Mechs, Xenomorphs, Borgs, and Hulks. Lethal force may be used against these targets if they prove hostile. Severe Personal Risk - sometimes getting close enough to a target to slap the cuffs on will create significant personal risk to the Officer. Deadly force from range is recommended to subdue Wizards and Changelings. Criminals in hostile environments such as space, fire, or plasma leaks also fall into this category, as do criminals believed to be in possession of high explosives. Ranged lethal force is the only reasonable option in these conditions. Armed and Dangerous - if a suspect is in possession of weapons, including stun weapons, and you have reasonable suspicion that they will use these against you, lethal force is permitted. Although in the majority of cases it is still preferable to attempt to detain them non-lethally. Unauthorized personnel in the armory are considered by default to be Armed and Dangerous, maximum force is permitted to subdue such targets. Multiple Hostiles - it can be extremely difficult to detain multiple hostiles. As a last resort if you are being mobbed you may deploy your baton in a harmful manner to thin the crowd. Generally it is better to retreat and regroup than stand your ground. Additionally, in the event of an attempted prison break, Security may fire lasers through the glass. They are expected to first fire a few warning shots before unloading their weapon into the target.","title":"Use of Deadly Force"},{"location":"Guides/Security%20guides/Space-Law/#minor-crimes","text":"All of these crimes carry a 1 minute sentence.

It is used to authenticate the activation of the on-station self destruct nuke as well as the syndicate nuke brought by the nuclear operatives. With nuke disk pinpointers and a variety of antag roles specialized on taking this disk away, this is THE MOST risky item to have on your persona. People interested in this item would be: 1) Nuke Ops . The most consistent and a force to be reckoned with. Their objective is to use this item to blow up the station. They are well armed and have disk pinpointers. 2) Wizards . Very dangerous and consistent, very well armed with their spells and magic weapons, they present a big threat to the station. They most of the time don't have a disk pinpointer, but they have teleportation so beware. 3) Traitors . The least dangerous and somewhat inconsistent. They may be assigned to steal the disk and leave the station, which leaves them vulnerable to be killed while trying to leave. 4) Death Squad . The most dangerous bar none, but very inconsistent, as they only appear during admin events. They are BY FAR the most well equipped people you will find, and ARE NOT to be taken slightly. The best option is setting the escape shuttle to arrive in the least time possible and getting out ASAP. They have access to disk pinpointers. 5) The station command. Of course, the Cap is going to be on the lookout for the disk if its lost, so beware of him if you are an antag. The Justitia \u00b6 Fancy laser pistol.

The Imperator \u00b6 The other fancy laser pistol. Can be found in the Captain 's locker or on his person most of the time. It also needs the proper keycard to be fired. Wanted by wizards and traitors . The Chain of Command \u00b6 A symbolic chain kept in the Captain 's office, on his person or in some rare occasions with the mime for some reason. It is wanted by wizards , traitors , and the mime . The captain usually does not care about this item, and it is left in his office. The Advanced Magboots \u00b6 Magnetic Boots found in the chief engineer's suit storage unit in their office. They work like every other pair of magboots but have no slowdown when turned on. They are wanted by wizards and traitors . Plasma Sheets \u00b6 Very flammable material with unusual physical and chemical properties. It is used to power the plasma generator and radiation collectors in the engineering department, by cargo to fulfill the station's mission, and by science to make very neat equipment. It is wanted by wizards and traitors . It is the most demanded item in this list, but also the most common, since it can be mined by shaft miners and the crew in various locations. The Ablative Trenchcoat \u00b6 An experimental trenchcoat that provides high resistance to energy and laser weapons. Kept in the Armory or in the Warden's locker. Wanted by wizards and traitors .

Shortly after round spawn, operatives and traitors will receive notifications telling them a code phrase to input into their PDAs in the ringtone configuration under settings. Traitors start with 20 Telecrystals (TC) while operatives start with 25 TC to spend on specialist equipment to complete their objectives. Traitor and Operative items: \u00b6 Category/Name Description TC cost CONSPICUOUS WEAPONS Obvious and hard to hide weapons. Makarov Pistol A small, easily concealable 9mm handgun. It deals 20 damage a shot and has a threaded barrel for suppressors. 7TC Energy Sword When turned off, can be hid in many regions, when on, is a very distinct, loud, and deadly light-saber esque blade. Deals high damage and can inflict body traumas. 8TC Lucifer .357 very loud and very powerful revolver, comparable to the cent officers own mateba. deals 50 damage a shot. 12TC Reverse Revolver Revolver that shoots anyone that tries to fire it, with one exception. 8TC AMMUNITION Ammo for weapons 9mm pistol magazine 9mm makarov ammo, currently deals 20 damage a shot. 1TC 9mm pistol magazine AP 9mm makarov ammo, negates 50% of armor on hit. 2TC 9mm pistol magazine incendiary 9mm makarov ammo, deals half damage (10) but adds two firestacks to hit targets, giving a net gain of damage 2TC .357 speedloader .357 ammo, used by the lucifer. 4TC EXPLOSIVES Explosives, used for AOE damage or destruction of important objects. Syndicate Minibomb stronger blast than a grenade, but hits a smaller total area. The detonation time after being activated is 5 seconds. 6TC C4 A bomb that can be attached to walls, objects, and people. It can be configured to detonate on a timer (minimum time 10 seconds), or can be paired with a remote signaller to be remotely triggered. To pair it, simply click the remote signaller on the C4 brick and they are paired. 1TC X4 C4 but more explosive. 4TC Pizza Bomb A bomb concealed in a pizza box. 10TC STEALTHY WEAPONS Easily concealed and hard to trace weapons. Energy Dagger A smaller and weaker esword disguised as a pen, can be placed anywhere you can fit a pen, like your PDA. 2TC Miniature Energy Crossbow An (expensive) self charging and easily hideable pocket crossbow that stuns and poisons those it hits. basically a self charging concealable tazer. When fired, it does not leave a message in the chat that would give away your identity 10TC Syndicate Holster A holster for storing all the guns you buy. Cannot currently be disguised, so it's not a very effective stealth tool at the moment. 1TC Suppressor Reduces the volume of guns with threaded barrels and it does not leave chat messages saying who fired it. Current weapons that can be silenced are Makarovs and Stalker SMGs. 3TC SUITS Various suits, typically of the spaceworthy variety. Syndicate Spacesuit A spacesuit that can be used similarly to other softsuits on the station. Despite being a softsuit, it is actually very protective, providing better stats than standard security officer armor. while it's main utility is for Traitors, don't forget that as a nuclear operative, this is a good option if you plan to sneak aboard the station and adopt a disguise as it is small enough to fit inside a backpack, allowing you to keep it for when you need to go loud or escape the station. 4TC Syndicate Hardsuit The same armoured blood-red hardsuit used by nuclear operatives. Very distinct looking, very robust. 8TC MISC. GADGETS Gadgets that don't fit in with others Chest Rig Acts as an 8 slot belt that can store guns, ammo, grenades, and all manner of other devices. Very cheap, very flexible storage, but also can't be hidden when worn. 1TC Cryptographic Sequencer Otherwise known as the Emag. It causes doors to open, and certain other machinery to malfunction. Generally, the effects of the Emag are permanent unless someone repairs the affected machines; For example, doors will stay permanently open until repaired. The effects of the Emag are powerful, but it does mean that you leave an obvious trail to follow if you are being pursued. The Emag has 5 regenerating charges, and you can see roughly how many you have left on the card's sprite. It regenerates one charge after 30 seconds. 6TC Surgical Equipment Bundle Comes with all the tools for surgery in a conspicuous, red and black duffel bag. 3TC Full Syndicate Toolbox A mechanical toolbox full of tools, but eviler. Small serrations on the exterior of the toolbox also give it slightly increased melee damage. 1TC Syndicate Soap Soap, but red, menacing. good for cleaning up any blood from your assassinations. 1TC (POINTLESS) BADASSERY Useless fun, or with very niche or RP oriented uses. Syndicate Balloon A baloon to show everyone you are with the syndicate, great for getting yourself shot. 20TC Briefcase Full of Cash A Briefcase full of cash, need I say more? 1TC Syndicate Smokes A pack of syndicate smokes, operate in style! 2TC BUNDLES Raw Telecrystals The currency for transactions made with the syndicate. Add them to a PDA by clicking on it with them in hand. If you kill another traitor, check to see if their uplink is still unlocked on their PDA and take their telecrystals for yourself. 1, 5, 10, or 20 TC Operative Exclusive Items: \u00b6 Some items are only available to Nuclear Operatives. Category/Name Description TC cost CONSPICUOUS WEAPONS Obvious and hard to hide weapons. Stalker SMG A .45 cal SMG. Hits pretty hard 10TC Bulldozer shotgun A drum-fed shotgun with a decent rate of fire. It accepts many different ammunition types, but the standard buckshot load is perhaps the deadliest one available to you. 8TC M90-gl carbine A strange 5.56 carbine with a high rate of fire and a currently non-functional under-barrel grenade launcher. Unremarkable without that grenade launcher, unfortunately, save for a very peculiar optional ammo type; 5.56 Phasic ammo. This ammo currently has some of the high armor penetration of any weapon in the game at 70%. Sadly, you can't get it with the carbine without declaring war or getting a fellow operative to donate 1TC to you. 18TC Buzzsaw LMG High capacity pain. This LMG fires fast, hits like a truck at 40 damage a bullet, and holds 50 rounds per magazine, making it one of the nastiest weapons available to you, especially if you invest in some of the alternate ammo types. 18TC Migraine .50 cal sniper rifle A slow firing sniper rifle. You might think it strange to bring a sniper with you on a space station assault, but it has a few qualities that are quite valuable. First, it's standard ammunition deals 70 damage a shot and is inherently armor piercing, reducing armor by 50%. Second, it has a very high bullet velocity, making it hard to dodge. Third, it stuns targets for a brief moment. All of these qualities makes it a very effective ambush weapon. 16TC Toy LMG A toy buzzsaw that fires donksoft darts 10TC Toy SMG A toy stalker that fires donksoft darts 5TC Surplus Rifle A cheap piece of trash that isn't particularly effective, but for the TC spent, It provides some value. Your free stalker is signficantly more effective and it's free, though, so don't buy this unless you're looking to meme around. 2TC Stechkin APS machine Pistol An automatic 9mm pistol. Similar overall effectiveness to the Makarov, but definitely more fun to use. 10TC 84mm Rocket Launcher A reloadable rocket launcher preloaded with an 84mm HE rocket grenade. With a very large blast radius, a potent weapon versus crowds. the alternate HEDP rocket also has utility for taking out heavily armored targets. 8TC Biohazardous chemical Sprayer A currently semi-functional tool. Chemicals are in an awkward state, balance wise, so this item isn't recommended for use just yet. 20TC AMMUNITION Ammo for Operative exclusive weapons 12g buckshot drum Powerful, and the spread makes it hard to dodge. 2TC 12g Dragons Breath drum the fun option. fires 4 low-damage flaming projectiles. A great option for sowing panic. While you are unlikely to drop people with dragon's breath, you will definitely distract them, and likely force a retreat so they can put themselves out. Repeatedly shooting people with dragon's breath isn't a very effective use of the ammo as a single shell will apply 4 firestacks to them, and characters can only receive 5 firestacks at a given time. Since they can't put themselves out, a single shell will eventually burn a critted player to death if they don't have any fire protection, as the damage potential is over 100. 2TC 12g slug drum Fires a single slug that deals slightly less total damage than buckshot, but has 20% armor penetration and a higher projectile velocity, so if you are facing armored targets or are fighting over distance, consider picking this. 3TC .45 Magazine An extra magazine for the stalker SMG. Grab a few of these if you plan to stick with it. 3TC .45 Magazine Incendiary Like other incendiary ammunition, this magazine deals half normal damage in exchange for igniting the target on fire. The stalker doesn't have a lot of synergy with incendiary ammunition, but it isn't a strictly bad purchase either, and it's cheap. 4TC .45 Magazine AP The stalker does have a lot of synergy with AP ammunition. If you know you are going to deal with a station prepared for your arrival or if you expect to encounter Unusually Tough Resistance, since you get the stalker for free, this is a very cost effective way to get 50% armor penetration in an automatic package. 5TC 7.12 Box Magazine More lead for the buzzsaw. Useful if the station is well populated or if you plan to use the buzzsaw as a literal saw to cut through windows and walls. 6TC 7.12 AP Box Magazine Expensive, but if you are going against a full squad of the best and baddest, accept no substitutes. 9TC 7.12 Incendiary Box Magazine This paired with the Elite Syndicate Hardsuit is a contender for one of the most cancerous weapon-ammo-armor combos in the game. The buzzsaw deals so much damage per shot that the half-damage penalty for incendiary ammo isn't as significant as with other weapons, and lighting people on fire creates a significant problem for them to deal with while they fight you. 6TC .50 Sniper Magazine With the low bullet count per magazine, you will probably have to buy a few of these (or better yet, buy the sniper bundle). Don't forget that this has 50% armor penetration as standard. 4TC .50 Penetrator Sniper Magazine Doesn't currently go through targets like it's supposed to, but it does have somewhat better AP qualities over the standard magazine. 5TC 5.56 Magazine Nothing remarkable when compared to the stock stalker you get. If you are going for the carbine, then you want to look at the variant below. 4TC 5.56 Magazine Phasic the cost is high, but so it the armor penetration. At 70% armor pen, this ammo destroys armored targets. It also has unusual projectile properties that can be advantageous. 8TC 40mm Grenade Rounds Box without access to a grenade launcher, pass on this for now. 6TC 84mm HE Rocket a high damage, wide blast area rocket. Use versus crowds. Also ensure that you have a space suit on because it will definitely punch a hole through the station. 4TC 84mm HEDP Rocket Doesn't have a very good use case (yet!). It does have high AP effects on the rocket's impact point, but because most of its damage is bomb damage, it's not even very good against centcom forces. 6TC 9mm stechkin Pistol Magazine More ammo for the fancy sidearm. 2TC Riot Dart Box ammo for the dart guns. 2TC EXPLOSIVES Operative exclusive explosive items, used for AOE damage or destruction of important objects. Grenadier's Belt Very expensive, but if you are planning to buy a lot of grenades, this belt provides good savings. Comes with 2 minibombs, 6 grenades, 2 EMP grenades, a multitool, and an evil screwdriver. 24TC EMP grenade box A box full of 7 EMP grenades. If you want to cause chaos on the station without blowing holes in it, this kit is a good option. 10TC SUITS Various suits, typically of the spaceworthy variety. Blood-Red Magboots For when you don't like the pair you start with for some reason. 2TC Elite Syndicate Hardsuit an upgrade over your standard blood red hardsuit, this suit's utility isn't derived from extra protection from laser and bullets (it's a bit better than the standard suit, but actually has slightly weaker laser protection). Instead, you get this for the enhanced protection to environmental damages, such as bomb, fire, and acid damage. This is a great choice if you are at risk of damaging yourself with your own AOE weaponry. 8TC MISC. GADGETS Gadgets that dont fit in with others Jaws of Life A handy power tool that can act as both a crowbar and wirecutters. It's main utility is that while in crowbar mode, it can force open powered airlocks, allowing you to force through any doors in your way. Do note that it's a bit loud when it does so, though, and it can't force open bolted doors, so a watchful AI can stall your progress. 4TC Syndicate Reinforcement This option buys you a small transponder that when activated opens a ghost role that lets one dead player spawn as an extra Nuclear Operative. They start with all the stock equipment, but no TC of their own, so you've got to share with them to get them equipped. That, combined with the price of this option means this item is really only viable if you've declared war on the station for extra TC. 25TC BUNDLES Think of the savings! Bioterror bundle Currently not worth getting as chemistry is underdeveloped. 12 TC saved. 30TC Bulldozer bundle Comes with a Bulldozer shotgun, a 12g stun slug drum and buckshot drum. Stun slugs are a useful way to get stuns if you need to take someone alive for one reason or another. Saves you 3TC 13TC Stalker bundle A duffel bag that comes with a stalker with a supressor and two extra magazines. 14TC Sniper bundle A briefcase that comes with a Migraine, two spare magazinrs, and a worn out suit and tie.

Makarov Pistol A small, easily concealable 9mm handgun. It deals 20 damage a shot and has a threaded barrel for suppressors. 7TC Energy Sword When turned off, can be hid in many regions, when on, is a very distinct, loud, and deadly light-saber esque blade. Deals high damage and can inflict body traumas. 8TC Lucifer .357 very loud and very powerful revolver, comparable to the cent officers own mateba. deals 50 damage a shot. 12TC Reverse Revolver Revolver that shoots anyone that tries to fire it, with one exception. 8TC AMMUNITION Ammo for weapons 9mm pistol magazine 9mm makarov ammo, currently deals 20 damage a shot. 1TC 9mm pistol magazine AP 9mm makarov ammo, negates 50% of armor on hit. 2TC 9mm pistol magazine incendiary 9mm makarov ammo, deals half damage (10) but adds two firestacks to hit targets, giving a net gain of damage 2TC .357 speedloader .357 ammo, used by the lucifer. 4TC EXPLOSIVES Explosives, used for AOE damage or destruction of important objects. Syndicate Minibomb stronger blast than a grenade, but hits a smaller total area. The detonation time after being activated is 5 seconds. 6TC C4 A bomb that can be attached to walls, objects, and people. It can be configured to detonate on a timer (minimum time 10 seconds), or can be paired with a remote signaller to be remotely triggered. To pair it, simply click the remote signaller on the C4 brick and they are paired. 1TC X4 C4 but more explosive. 4TC Pizza Bomb A bomb concealed in a pizza box. 10TC STEALTHY WEAPONS Easily concealed and hard to trace weapons. Energy Dagger A smaller and weaker esword disguised as a pen, can be placed anywhere you can fit a pen, like your PDA. 2TC Miniature Energy Crossbow An (expensive) self charging and easily hideable pocket crossbow that stuns and poisons those it hits. basically a self charging concealable tazer. When fired, it does not leave a message in the chat that would give away your identity 10TC Syndicate Holster A holster for storing all the guns you buy. Cannot currently be disguised, so it's not a very effective stealth tool at the moment. 1TC Suppressor Reduces the volume of guns with threaded barrels and it does not leave chat messages saying who fired it. Current weapons that can be silenced are Makarovs and Stalker SMGs. 3TC SUITS Various suits, typically of the spaceworthy variety. Syndicate Spacesuit A spacesuit that can be used similarly to other softsuits on the station. Despite being a softsuit, it is actually very protective, providing better stats than standard security officer armor. while it's main utility is for Traitors, don't forget that as a nuclear operative, this is a good option if you plan to sneak aboard the station and adopt a disguise as it is small enough to fit inside a backpack, allowing you to keep it for when you need to go loud or escape the station. 4TC Syndicate Hardsuit The same armoured blood-red hardsuit used by nuclear operatives. Very distinct looking, very robust. 8TC MISC. GADGETS Gadgets that don't fit in with others Chest Rig Acts as an 8 slot belt that can store guns, ammo, grenades, and all manner of other devices. Very cheap, very flexible storage, but also can't be hidden when worn. 1TC Cryptographic Sequencer Otherwise known as the Emag. It causes doors to open, and certain other machinery to malfunction. Generally, the effects of the Emag are permanent unless someone repairs the affected machines; For example, doors will stay permanently open until repaired. The effects of the Emag are powerful, but it does mean that you leave an obvious trail to follow if you are being pursued. The Emag has 5 regenerating charges, and you can see roughly how many you have left on the card's sprite. It regenerates one charge after 30 seconds. 6TC Surgical Equipment Bundle Comes with all the tools for surgery in a conspicuous, red and black duffel bag. 3TC Full Syndicate Toolbox A mechanical toolbox full of tools, but eviler. Small serrations on the exterior of the toolbox also give it slightly increased melee damage. 1TC Syndicate Soap Soap, but red, menacing. good for cleaning up any blood from your assassinations. 1TC (POINTLESS) BADASSERY Useless fun, or with very niche or RP oriented uses. Syndicate Balloon A baloon to show everyone you are with the syndicate, great for getting yourself shot. 20TC Briefcase Full of Cash A Briefcase full of cash, need I say more? 1TC Syndicate Smokes A pack of syndicate smokes, operate in style! 2TC BUNDLES Raw Telecrystals The currency for transactions made with the syndicate. Add them to a PDA by clicking on it with them in hand. If you kill another traitor, check to see if their uplink is still unlocked on their PDA and take their telecrystals for yourself. 1, 5, 10, or 20 TC","title":"Traitor and Operative items:"},{"location":"Items/Syndicate%20Items/#operative-exclusive-items","text":"Some items are only available to Nuclear Operatives. Category/Name Description TC cost CONSPICUOUS WEAPONS Obvious and hard to hide weapons. Stalker SMG A .45 cal SMG. Hits pretty hard 10TC Bulldozer shotgun A drum-fed shotgun with a decent rate of fire. It accepts many different ammunition types, but the standard buckshot load is perhaps the deadliest one available to you. 8TC M90-gl carbine A strange 5.56 carbine with a high rate of fire and a currently non-functional under-barrel grenade launcher. Unremarkable without that grenade launcher, unfortunately, save for a very peculiar optional ammo type; 5.56 Phasic ammo. This ammo currently has some of the high armor penetration of any weapon in the game at 70%. Sadly, you can't get it with the carbine without declaring war or getting a fellow operative to donate 1TC to you. 18TC Buzzsaw LMG High capacity pain. This LMG fires fast, hits like a truck at 40 damage a bullet, and holds 50 rounds per magazine, making it one of the nastiest weapons available to you, especially if you invest in some of the alternate ammo types. 18TC Migraine .50 cal sniper rifle A slow firing sniper rifle. You might think it strange to bring a sniper with you on a space station assault, but it has a few qualities that are quite valuable. First, it's standard ammunition deals 70 damage a shot and is inherently armor piercing, reducing armor by 50%. Second, it has a very high bullet velocity, making it hard to dodge. Third, it stuns targets for a brief moment. All of these qualities makes it a very effective ambush weapon. 16TC Toy LMG A toy buzzsaw that fires donksoft darts 10TC Toy SMG A toy stalker that fires donksoft darts 5TC Surplus Rifle A cheap piece of trash that isn't particularly effective, but for the TC spent, It provides some value. Your free stalker is signficantly more effective and it's free, though, so don't buy this unless you're looking to meme around. 2TC Stechkin APS machine Pistol An automatic 9mm pistol. Similar overall effectiveness to the Makarov, but definitely more fun to use. 10TC 84mm Rocket Launcher A reloadable rocket launcher preloaded with an 84mm HE rocket grenade. With a very large blast radius, a potent weapon versus crowds. the alternate HEDP rocket also has utility for taking out heavily armored targets. 8TC Biohazardous chemical Sprayer A currently semi-functional tool. Chemicals are in an awkward state, balance wise, so this item isn't recommended for use just yet. 20TC AMMUNITION Ammo for Operative exclusive weapons 12g buckshot drum Powerful, and the spread makes it hard to dodge. 2TC 12g Dragons Breath drum the fun option. fires 4 low-damage flaming projectiles. A great option for sowing panic. While you are unlikely to drop people with dragon's breath, you will definitely distract them, and likely force a retreat so they can put themselves out. Repeatedly shooting people with dragon's breath isn't a very effective use of the ammo as a single shell will apply 4 firestacks to them, and characters can only receive 5 firestacks at a given time. Since they can't put themselves out, a single shell will eventually burn a critted player to death if they don't have any fire protection, as the damage potential is over 100. 2TC 12g slug drum Fires a single slug that deals slightly less total damage than buckshot, but has 20% armor penetration and a higher projectile velocity, so if you are facing armored targets or are fighting over distance, consider picking this. 3TC .45 Magazine An extra magazine for the stalker SMG. Grab a few of these if you plan to stick with it. 3TC .45 Magazine Incendiary Like other incendiary ammunition, this magazine deals half normal damage in exchange for igniting the target on fire. The stalker doesn't have a lot of synergy with incendiary ammunition, but it isn't a strictly bad purchase either, and it's cheap. 4TC .45 Magazine AP The stalker does have a lot of synergy with AP ammunition. If you know you are going to deal with a station prepared for your arrival or if you expect to encounter Unusually Tough Resistance, since you get the stalker for free, this is a very cost effective way to get 50% armor penetration in an automatic package. 5TC 7.12 Box Magazine More lead for the buzzsaw. Useful if the station is well populated or if you plan to use the buzzsaw as a literal saw to cut through windows and walls. 6TC 7.12 AP Box Magazine Expensive, but if you are going against a full squad of the best and baddest, accept no substitutes. 9TC 7.12 Incendiary Box Magazine This paired with the Elite Syndicate Hardsuit is a contender for one of the most cancerous weapon-ammo-armor combos in the game.

Fire is a special exception, as most xenomorph varieties take bonus damage from fire. Xenomorphs' current implementation is unfinished. \"They're coming outta the Goddamn walls!\" \u00b6 Xenomorphs have a complex maturation cycle, starting off as a facehugger, which latches onto a human or monkey to impregnate them with a chestburster, which evolves into an adult xenomorph. Facehuggers are extremely dangerous to fight in confined spaces or without ranged weapons. A facehugger will automatically render a person unconscious for a few seconds once it latches onto their face, which means if you don't have friends looking for you, you're dead. Masks provide only a second or two of protection as the facehugger can rip them off. Helmets provide a greater amount of protection, as facehuggers cannot rip them off, but they do have a small chance to destroy the helmet completely with each latch attempt. Once a facehugger latches onto a victim's face, they will begin planting a larva, aka a chestburster. he incubation time for a larva is 5 minutes.

The first is the xenomorph drone. Drones have 150 hp and deal 15 brute damage per melee attack. 1 drone can be promoted to a queen if there are no queens present. There are also xenomorph hunters and sentinels, which are currently mostly the same as drones, but cannot be promoted to a queen. Once a xenomorph drone lives long enough, they will evolve into a queen, a fully mature xenomorph. Currently, there will be 1 queen in a given xeno infestation. Queens have 300 hp and move significantly slower. Their melee attack is faster and deals 30 brute damage, so they should be prioritized when fighting a hive. Queens have the unique ability to lay facehugger eggs. These eggs take a period of time to grow before they are ready to hatch, but once they are ready, the eggs will hatch when it senses a potential host is nearby, in which it will open, sprouting a new xenomorph facehugger. Eggs can be easily destroyed in their developing stage with a single melee attack, but become a bit tougher once fully grown.","title":"Xenomorph"},{"location":"Mobs/Xenomorph/#xenomorph","text":"Xenomorphs are a threat that can be encountered on asteroids , in Caverna , and, rarely, at the |mainstation.

Access levels: anywhere they can teleport to , Difficulty: hard . The Blob is a sentient biomass that highjacks a player character's body with the goal of blowing up said body;spreading and consuming the entire station. Taco Tuesday \u00b6 So you took one extra taco from the kitchen and now feel the sudden urge to walk into maintenance so you can think about your life choices. If you are the blob, you will recive a warning about your upcoming transformation with various messages urging you to find a dark isolated place and cower. you will almost certainly know when you are just about to turn, and before then you should try your best to reduce the stations ability to fight you. your time as a human is limited, and once it is up your body will burst and turn into a blob core, wether or not you are prepared. Good locations to turn include isolated pockets of maintenence, unattended departments, space, or, if you feel like taking a gamble, regions near critical functions such as power or atmospherics In order, when you learn you are a blob you should: Think of a location where you want to set up your blob core. prepare the location so you can rapidly access it when you are about to turn (by deconstructing walls or hacking doors) absolutely make sure you know how to get there, and how to get there fast, from almost any spot on the station wander around stealthily cutting wires, turning off batteries, sabotoging the reactor, spacing regions, etc. when you are about to turn into a blob sprint to your chosen location, ignore everything else. When you become a blob for real it is important not to reveal yourself too early, as you are VERY vulnerable. dont intentionally breach walls into open areas or hallways. focus on building up your economy before you are detected, building as many resource nodes as possible. Ideally by the time you are found you should have a well built economy and be able to rapidly set up defenses. If you somehow get undetected until the station announcer says you exist you should begin to setup defenses preemptively. The midphase of blob is typically marked by when the blob switches from economy buildup to spreading wide and is when most conflict with the crew occurs. Focus on eliminating any attackers, either through raw brute force or by trapping them before attacking them. Emitters will serve as the crews most powerful weapon against you, and can rapidly cut a path towards your core. Reflective nodes can be helpful, but will also be among the first the crew targets. if your core itself is in the path of an emitter, move it. to eliminate an emitter, build towards it parralell to its blasts, it is a machine like any other and can thus be rapidly broken down with directed attacks. Fire and explosives, while they can be devestating, are typically more harmful to the crew than they are to you. something to note is that you can space regions by breaking glass windows. This is helpful, as those in space suits and hardsuits are slower, and there arent many suits on the station to begin with. Blob factories can be useful in rare situations to harass players with floating blob spores, but are often more expensive than they are useful. When you are confident that any crew retaliation has been adequetly repelled, it is time to switch to late-game blob. just expand, fucking everywhere. place nodes wherever they fit, dont be afraid to fill hallways, rapidly build towards and destroy critical station functions. The crew can do little to stop you, as your resource gains are incredibly fast. If you have more than 250 tiles and the crew is repelled, you can be reasonably confident that you have won. Upon reaching 400 tiles, you will get to critical mass. in this state you will gain absurd amounts of resources very quickly, your attacks are devestating, and your nodes create massive swathes of blob tiles instantly. you have, by all accounts, won.

Good locations to turn include isolated pockets of maintenence, unattended departments, space, or, if you feel like taking a gamble, regions near critical functions such as power or atmospherics In order, when you learn you are a blob you should: Think of a location where you want to set up your blob core. prepare the location so you can rapidly access it when you are about to turn (by deconstructing walls or hacking doors) absolutely make sure you know how to get there, and how to get there fast, from almost any spot on the station wander around stealthily cutting wires, turning off batteries, sabotoging the reactor, spacing regions, etc. when you are about to turn into a blob sprint to your chosen location, ignore everything else. When you become a blob for real it is important not to reveal yourself too early, as you are VERY vulnerable. dont intentionally breach walls into open areas or hallways. focus on building up your economy before you are detected, building as many resource nodes as possible. Ideally by the time you are found you should have a well built economy and be able to rapidly set up defenses. If you somehow get undetected until the station announcer says you exist you should begin to setup defenses preemptively. The midphase of blob is typically marked by when the blob switches from economy buildup to spreading wide and is when most conflict with the crew occurs. Focus on eliminating any attackers, either through raw brute force or by trapping them before attacking them. Emitters will serve as the crews most powerful weapon against you, and can rapidly cut a path towards your core. Reflective nodes can be helpful, but will also be among the first the crew targets. if your core itself is in the path of an emitter, move it. to eliminate an emitter, build towards it parralell to its blasts, it is a machine like any other and can thus be rapidly broken down with directed attacks. Fire and explosives, while they can be devestating, are typically more harmful to the crew than they are to you. something to note is that you can space regions by breaking glass windows. This is helpful, as those in space suits and hardsuits are slower, and there arent many suits on the station to begin with. Blob factories can be useful in rare situations to harass players with floating blob spores, but are often more expensive than they are useful. When you are confident that any crew retaliation has been adequetly repelled, it is time to switch to late-game blob. just expand, fucking everywhere. place nodes wherever they fit, dont be afraid to fill hallways, rapidly build towards and destroy critical station functions. The crew can do little to stop you, as your resource gains are incredibly fast. If you have more than 250 tiles and the crew is repelled, you can be reasonably confident that you have won. Upon reaching 400 tiles, you will get to critical mass. in this state you will gain absurd amounts of resources very quickly, your attacks are devestating, and your nodes create massive swathes of blob tiles instantly. you have, by all accounts, won. Go ahead and masscre the crew that tried and failed to contain you.","title":"Taco Tuesday"},{"location":"Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Blob/#main-abilities","text":"Icon Name Cost description Build Strong 15 Build Reflective 15 Build Node 50 Builds a blob node Allows you to relocate core to that node Blob tiles auto generate around it Build Factory 50 Places a blob factory which spawns blob that attack players Build Resource 40 Places a resource factory to grow more biomass faster Relocate Core 80 Relocates your core to a node Remove Blob N/A Removes a blob tile Rally Spores N/A Tells your spores to converge on one location (doesn't as of 4116) Readapt Strain 40 Allows the blob to change their strain Reroll Strains 20 Rerolls list of strains","title":"Main Abilities"},{"location":"Roles/Antagonist%20roles/Blob/#blob-types","text":"Name Description Abilities Damage Armour Debris Devourer Eats everything in its path, items, objects, and humanoids.

How to get started \u00b6 As a nuke operative you will spawn at the Syndicate base or near a When you have made your plan, board the syndicate shuttle and head off towards the station (which is near 0,0.

The shuttle contains the nuke, the very thing you need to complete your mission, as well as lots of useful equipment that boarding station personnel could easily turn on you. The shuttle also has a small dedicated medical bay which comes with the furnishings to treat wounds and perform surgery. It also has oxygen gear vital for keeping you alive in the vacuum of space. Many a new nukie has died out in the cold airless void because they forgot to turn on their internals. Your gear and you \u00b6 The stock nukie gear consists of your uniform, night vision goggles, hardsuit helm, a syndicate mask, your signature red hardsuit, a pair of red magboots or black jackboots, your headset, gloves, an oxygen tank, a stalker SMG, a PDA which has your telecrystal uplink, and your trusty stetchkin pistol. Your night vision does exactly what youd expect, letting you see in dark areas. The hardsuit helm and torso pieces make you immune to the cold and pressure, while offering very decent protection against weapons and explosives. You are not invincible in these however, and getting shot will still hurt. The headset doesn't let you hear the crew, but it does give you access to your own syndicate channel. The Stalker will be your main offensive weapon unless you choose to buy something else to replace it. Be sure to bring extra ammo for it, as it burns through magazines rapidly. The stetchkin is a small but scrappy fallback pistol. Use it if you've run out of other ammo or wish to conserve it.

The advantage you get for doing so is a lot a of bonus TC; Near the operations console will be a few TC Withdrawal stations, each of which will dispense extra TC every minute for 20 minutes, giving you a total of 280TC extra to buy loads of fun equipment you can't normally afford to buy. There is no requirement to wait until the full 280TC has been dispensed, and it is advised that once you've made all the purchases you want, start heading for the station ASAP, as the longer you wait, the more time they have to prepare for your arrival.

Access: Whatever your selected Role has. Difficulty: Medium - hard . Overview \u00b6 Traitor is one of the three types of Antagonist roles that can spawn, with the other two currently in the game being Nuke Ops and Cargonia . MISSION SPECIFICATIONS DECRYPTED. WELCOME TO THE SYNDICATE. \u00b6 As a Traitor, you spawn as the station role you selected, with no visual distinction from everyone else. However, you are massively different from any other crew member: You're part of the Syndicate . Maybe you're a hardcore follower of the Syndicate ways; maybe you've just got a score to settle; or maybe you're just some poor sap who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and now you've been blackmailed into service. Whatever your motivation is, you have one job: Complete your assigned objectives. Traitors get 3 objectives, shown at the round start in the chat: Steal a random high-tier item, assassinate a random crew member (often a department head), and survive until the end of the round. An example of what your objectives could be: Steal the Chain of Command (found in the captain's quarters) Assassinate Mr. Engineering man sir, Chief Engineer Escape on the Emergency Shuttle alive Remember, if you ever need a reminder of what they are (or need to remember your uplink code) hit the objective reminder button at the top of the screen. It looks like a pair of bloody shoes. Buying weapons and equipment from the Telecrystal Uplink \u00b6 One of the most important items to you as a traitor is your PDA. In order to assist in your mission, the syndicate have incorporated an uplink that allows you to purchase a limited selection from a large list of weapons and tools. At the start of your round as traitor, you will be given a case-sensitive password composed of a NATO alphabet letter and three numbers that you put on the ringtone changer under the options menu in your PDA. You will get to a screen that has weapons. Be sure to have your off hand empty or the items you purchase will drop onto the floor. However, the items cost a special finite resource called telecrystals (TC), and you have only 20 to spend, so make your purchases carefully. Acquiring more TC is functionally improbable, as it requires you to kill another traitor who has their own uplink still unlocked and they haven't spent it all. To see what's available to buy and some general footnotes about the items, go here. \u00b6 Theft objectives \u00b6 Often one or both of your objectives requires you to steal something. How hard this is depends on the item and whether the job that starts with it is filled by another player. Theft objectives will often require you to break into secure areas or to steal the items directly off of other players. Sometimes it will be shockingly easy, easier than taking candy from a baby. Other times it will be so impossible that you should probably take the L and try to have fun getting up to shenanigans with your exclusive traitor items. It all depends on what state the station is in and how many players are alive. Still, woe betide anyone who gets the objective steal the Justitia. to see a complete list of steal objects you can expect to get, take a look at the High Risk Items page. \u00b6 Murder objectives \u00b6 Another common objective is to murder a particular crewmember on the station. Sometimes this can be challenging, but engineering someone's death can often be as simple as asking them to come to your office to look at this 'problem' and then shooting them in the back of the head with a silenced makarov. The harder part is usually getting away with it, especially if you commit the murder early in the round. Honestly, one of the best pieces of advice to take to heart with murder objectives it to take your time, play it safe, build up a relationship with the target and other gullible crewmembers, and waiting for a perfect time to strike. Heck, given how a typical round of UnityStation goes, it's likely that after a long enough amount of time, they will have died to some other threat on the station, taking care of your objective for you. When that happens, just ensure that they stay dead. If their body ends up being brought to medical, they will likely get revived or cloned, which will set you back to square one. General Tips: \u00b6 Consider saving some TC for a rainy day. \u00b6 Its UnityStation, you never know what is going to happen. You may have lost your gun or you just ran out of ammo. Maybe you're trapped in a rapidly deteriorating station and all you need is a toolbox to hack yourself out of a depowered room. Not spending all of your TC at once will lend you some valuable flexibility in the late game. Acquire access. \u00b6 One great way to improve your odds of success is to acquire additional access, either through the proper way of asking the Head of Personnel to upgrade your clearance or by more nefarious means such as stealing another person's ID card. You need to go to all the places you can to get your items, and the captain's bedroom may be the place you need to break into to complete your objectives, and it's a lot easier and less conspicuous to get in there with an ID card than by hacking or emagging the door or by cutting through the walls. Be polite \u00b6 This may be the best advice you can take. Somehow, if you are polite people can even turn a blind eye on you trying to murder them if they are not entirely aware of your status as a traitor. When people start to look for others to blame, they are inclined to pick the mean guy, so being friendly, helpful, and generally cooperative can often set you up for success under quite incriminating circumstances. This can extend even as far as when you've already been captured and brigged, as a positive and understanding attitude can keep your sentence short. Please, if you are lucky enough to have a lawyer available to you, consult with them. They are your best chance at avoiding a permanent sentence or execution. They might even get your charges completely thrown out on occasion. Miscellaneous tips: \u00b6 Most security firearms are equipped with ID locked electronic firing pins which will not allow you to shoot their weapons without having security clearance. This makes stealing their gear an unreliable strategy. There are a few notable exceptions, such as the stun baton, which is a very effective ambush weapon that you should steal if you can manage it. Handcuffs are another good pick. Never underestimate the power of slippables like banana peels and soap. Many haughty crewmembers have met their end at the hands of a Clown dragging around a peel behind him, only to be bludgeoned into unconsciousness while down and thrown into space. You can impersonate another person by wearing a face covering and putting on their ID card. Talking will give away your identity in chat, but as long as you stay silent, you will identify as whatever name is recorded on the ID. Wearing a space suit or some other total body covering will help sell the false identity even further. Even if it seems like you are alone, beware of security cameras. If there's an active statiom AI, it's impossible to predict when they have their eye on you and when they don't. Do your dirty business out of sight, such as in maintenance tunnels or, if you must, disable security cameras in the areas you have to operate in. Disabling cameras is risky, though, as they or another bystander might see you do it. The new blind spot might catch the AI's attention as well.

In order to assist in your mission, the syndicate have incorporated an uplink that allows you to purchase a limited selection from a large list of weapons and tools. At the start of your round as traitor, you will be given a case-sensitive password composed of a NATO alphabet letter and three numbers that you put on the ringtone changer under the options menu in your PDA. You will get to a screen that has weapons. Be sure to have your off hand empty or the items you purchase will drop onto the floor. However, the items cost a special finite resource called telecrystals (TC), and you have only 20 to spend, so make your purchases carefully.

The harder part is usually getting away with it, especially if you commit the murder early in the round. Honestly, one of the best pieces of advice to take to heart with murder objectives it to take your time, play it safe, build up a relationship with the target and other gullible crewmembers, and waiting for a perfect time to strike. Heck, given how a typical round of UnityStation goes, it's likely that after a long enough amount of time, they will have died to some other threat on the station, taking care of your objective for you. When that happens, just ensure that they stay dead.

Somehow, if you are polite people can even turn a blind eye on you trying to murder them if they are not entirely aware of your status as a traitor.

This makes stealing their gear an unreliable strategy. There are a few notable exceptions, such as the stun baton, which is a very effective ambush weapon that you should steal if you can manage it. Handcuffs are another good pick. Never underestimate the power of slippables like banana peels and soap. Many haughty crewmembers have met their end at the hands of a Clown dragging around a peel behind him, only to be bludgeoned into unconsciousness while down and thrown into space. You can impersonate another person by wearing a face covering and putting on their ID card. Talking will give away your identity in chat, but as long as you stay silent, you will identify as whatever name is recorded on the ID. Wearing a space suit or some other total body covering will help sell the false identity even further. Even if it seems like you are alone, beware of security cameras. If there's an active statiom AI, it's impossible to predict when they have their eye on you and when they don't. Do your dirty business out of sight, such as in maintenance tunnels or, if you must, disable security cameras in the areas you have to operate in. Disabling cameras is risky, though, as they or another bystander might see you do it. The new blind spot might catch the AI's attention as well.

Miners , \" - A wise QM King of the delivery squad \u00b6 As the QM, your job is simple, you oversee the regular operations of cargo, be that paperwork, orders, exports, or coordinating mining operations on some god-forsaken rock from the comfort of your office. While the normal Cargo Techs are good at moving crates and making money, they tend to have trouble juggling bounties and spending that money. This is where you come in. Check with other departments to see what supplies they are running low on, and buy them, either in person or over the radio, they'll be more than happy to inform you. You should also almost always buy meat crates for the Chef and metal for engineering as soon as you can, as stocks of both run out rapidly. Requests \u00b6 Oftentimes, you wont be the one asking others if they need supplies, rather, the crew will be asking you. You could be a prick and hand anyone asking for so much as a pen ten sheets of paperwork, which will likely result in your untimely demise, or you can heed their requests like an ordinary human being. The requests you'll get will range anywhere from spare generators to clowning tools. You will generally be expected to fulfill these requests in a reasonable time-frame and have someone deliver the goods to the relevant department or room. A critical part of fulfilling requests that you must coordinate with your Cargo Techs is crate reclamation.'' Shipping crates can be exchanged for a significant portion of their original cost, sometimes as high as 100% (\"''it's free real state.\") of their purchase price. Always badger people about the crates they have taken and not returned. Stretch those dollars as far as you can. Exports \u00b6 To spend money, you must make money, and the way you do that is through exports. The way this is done is very simple. Drag whatever you want to sell onto the Cargo Shuttle and send it to Centcom. Lockers and crates (see above) are worth a sizable amount, with the prior being manufacturable with some metal for easy money. Other exports may include raw material, Bounties, stolen goods from other departments, refined ore, produce from botany, and generally whatever else you can find with your export scanner. When the miners actually survive their expedition and grace your department with a fresh haul of ore, you should: Distribute all construction materials (glass and metal) to lathes or Engineer Give solid plasma and uranium to engineering for powering the station.

While the normal Cargo Techs are good at moving crates and making money, they tend to have trouble juggling bounties and spending that money. This is where you come in. Check with other departments to see what supplies they are running low on, and buy them, either in person or over the radio, they'll be more than happy to inform you. You should also almost always buy meat crates for the Chef and metal for engineering as soon as you can, as stocks of both run out rapidly.","title":"King of the delivery squad"},{"location":"Roles/Cargo%20roles/Quartermaster/#requests","text":"Oftentimes, you wont be the one asking others if they need supplies, rather, the crew will be asking you. You could be a prick and hand anyone asking for so much as a pen ten sheets of paperwork, which will likely result in your untimely demise, or you can heed their requests like an ordinary human being. The requests you'll get will range anywhere from spare generators to clowning tools. You will generally be expected to fulfill these requests in a reasonable time-frame and have someone deliver the goods to the relevant department or room. A critical part of fulfilling requests that you must coordinate with your Cargo Techs is crate reclamation.'' Shipping crates can be exchanged for a significant portion of their original cost, sometimes as high as 100% (\"''it's free real state.\") of their purchase price.

The way this is done is very simple. Drag whatever you want to sell onto the Cargo Shuttle and send it to Centcom. Lockers and crates (see above) are worth a sizable amount, with the prior being manufacturable with some metal for easy money. Other exports may include raw material, Bounties, stolen goods from other departments, refined ore, produce from botany, and generally whatever else you can find with your export scanner. When the miners actually survive their expedition and grace your department with a fresh haul of ore, you should: Distribute all construction materials (glass and metal) to lathes or Engineer Give solid plasma and uranium to engineering for powering the station.

Access: Mining department , Cargo department , Maintenance. Difficulty: Hard - Very Hard Overview \u00b6 Shaft Miner is one of the most dangerous roles that is not a Command role. Not because you have a lot of responsibilities (you don't, you only have two: fulfill the mining quota and come back alive ). It's hard because you will often run into hordes of Xenomorphs and space carp that will kill you fast if you're not good at the combat system. This is Mining, someone stole our shuttle. Anyone know who it was? \u00b6 As a Shaft Miner, the station crew expects you to head out into space, mine ores from asteroids or lavaland, and get Cargo some money. You're also expected to be at least somewhat robust , since you'll run into a lot of Aliens out there. To assist in your efforts, you get given a multitude of tools: A Mining Hardsuit to protect you from the cold, airless vacuum of space as well as to give you very slight protection against damage; a mining satchel to store ores in; a lantern, since space is dark; and a pickaxe and shovel to mine ores and dig sand out of the asteroid ground. Since you're part of the Cargo department, you're under the supervision of the Quartermaster , so ask them for help if you're ever confused on what to do. Also, if Cargo is flushed with Cargo Technicians who know what they are doing, the Quartermaster has their own set of mining gear in their office, and may join you on your adventures in deep space. General tips and tricks. \u00b6 You also have a Proto-Kinetic Accelerator, otherwise known as the Shaft Miner's best friend. It is a short range, high-damage, unlimited-use gun that can be used for propulsion in deep space, breaking asteroid rocks, and killing things. Its weaknesses include a slow rate of fire and a short range of 3 tiles. Mining typically begins with five in the locker room and a sixth in the |QM's office locker. Two more come in the mining equipment crate purchaseable by the cargo console. When mining with the pickaxe, keep in mind you can mine multiple chunks of rock at the same time as long as they are adjacent to you. This drastically speeds up mining operations. However, that is currently imposible as you need to use your gun for mining. It is recommended that when possible you buy the plasma cutter, as it is much more effective than the Proto-Kinetic Accelerator. You should also make use of the ore box. Ore boxes are handy, as they reduce the amount of fiddling with equipment. Ore boxes can be dragged behind you as you move to pick up any ore you pull the box over. In addition to the Common channel, the Shaft Miner's headset comes with access to the Supplies channel to communicate with the rest of Cargo , and the Science channel to organize what minerals and ores are needed to conduct R&D (when implemented).

This is best asked for as soon as possible before they leave their office. If you have a Quartermaster , ask them apply pressure to a resistant or distracted Captain, or involve the Head of Personnel ; you cannot do your job quite as effectively without those coordinates. The station is depending upon you to fulfill the quota or everyone misses out on that sweet, sweet greentext. Ore is processed at the Ore Redemption Machine. You can load ore into it by hand. Ore boxes are loaded by pulling them adjacent to the ORM and hitting the load ores button in the ORM's interface. Once Ores are loaded, they are added to the station's Material Silo, which lets all lathes around the station instantly have access to the materials for item construction and withdrawal. Pretty handy. An important mechanic to understand about the ORM is Labor points. Labor points are a reward offered at the ORM for all ore you load into the ORM. Once you have finished loading all your ore, hit the claim button to transfer the labor points you have earned to your ID. Labor points can be spent on special and upgraded gear at the Mining Equipment Vendor: Name Uses Labor Points Price Pickaxe a standard pickaxe for mining. 100 points Silver-Plated Pickaxe an improved pickaxe that mines considerably faster. deals slightly more damage. 1000 points Diamond-Tipped pickaxe a pickaxe that mines much faster than the standard and also deals more damage. 2000 points Proto-Kinetic Accelerator infinite use mining gun you know and love. 750 points Shovel Use it to dig up sand for glass. 100 points Explorer's Webbing Some tactical webbing that goes takes the belt slot.

In order to fuel the shuttle, you must take the wrench stashed in the engine room and wrench down the plasma canister onto the fuel connector. If your shuttle does not come with a plasma canister, you will have to acquire one from science or atmospherics. Go to hell. \u00b6 So, fighting \"the perfect organism\" covered in spikes and larger than you repeatedley while mining asteroids hurtling through the void isnt enough of a challenge? Well good news, because (so long as the admins enable it) you can go and mine on a world perpetually fogged by ash and covered in lava. This is where the \"very hard\" rating comes in. If you arent skilled or well prepared, you will die horribly and nobody will find your roasted corpse. If your going to lavaland, its best you go with buds, pack an actual gun, and have practiced kiting with xenos and other beasts. Note, lavaland is not complete, and does not pose much of a challenge currently. Build a casino. \u00b6 This is technically optional, but if you plan to not finish the mission instantly, one of the best ways to use the absurd amounts of resources produced by mining is to build a casino. The materials are there to build tables, chairs, dices, weird roulette systems, clown hitting contests and more by using the building guide.

Access : Everything . Difficulty : Stupid Easy - Extreme . Note: Death squad, for reasons that should be made clear by the end of this guide, is not a round-start role. It can only be accessed via events. RIP AND TEAR \u00b6 Your goal is simple. Kill anything that moves on the station and blow it to high hell with the onboard nuke. This is typically because the station decided to \"form a union\", is infested in some way, or is so fucked beyond repair that it may just be best for NT to kill everyone and cover it up. The amount of resistance you'll face will vary wildly, but this wont typically pose a problem, as you are equipped with the most flat out overpowered gear anyone can lay hands on. Without exaggeration, two or three robust death troopers can waste an entire station. HUUUGE GUNS \u00b6 Death Squad troopers spawn with a potent personal arsenal. This gear is the Mateba revolver, your trusty disruptor cannon, your SWAT MK3 helmet, armor, and magboots. The mateba revolver packs as much punch as a desert eagle ('60** brute damage) The disruptor cannon can ''rapid-fire lasers that deal 50 burn damage per shot, enough to kill most targets, human or otherwise, in two or three hits. Your armor is space-proof and does not slow you down and it has a higher resistance than even Nuke ops armor against most kinds of damage, possessing 80% bullet resistance, 90% brute melee resistance (including the underclothes), and 100% bomb resistance;'' You can blow a grenade ''in your hand and take zero damage. Note that energy weapon resistance is just 50%, so take out guys with laser guns first, and also watch out for tasers; as tough as you are, they can give the mob of frantic station crewmembers enough time to disarm you and shoot you with your own weapons. The magboots act as any other magboots, and allow you to better engage in combat in areas where the atmosphere is shifting due to breaches or opened canisters. Nuke it from orbit \u00b6 Turns out that the best way to kill something is a large nuclear warhead. While you are not provided one, the station thankfully has one onboard. Your primary goal is to grab the disk, shove it in this nuke, and detonate it with the code provided to you by your overseers. Here's a handy braindead guide to success at Deathsquad: Walk towards the nuke disk using your disk tracker if you see something that is alive while walking to the disk, shoot it dead. grab the disk, you may have to kill whoever is holding it walk to the station's onboard nuke. Shove in the disk input the nuke code disable safety and start the timer get as far away from it as you can Death Row \u00b6 So, Centcom's sent a station alert saying in no exhaustive terms how much of a disappointment you have been, and that they've just decided to wipe the slate clean. You're much more the problem then the victim, and they just feel it'd be easier to replace than recover. A Death Squad is on its way right now. What should you do? Well first, you should appraise what tools are available to you, namely; can you get a taser or not? If you have access to security, get a taser as fast as you can. It's the only way you'll stand a chance in a direct confrontation. Other crewmembers will know this, too, so they will go extremely fast. you should also procure other weapons, especially energy weapons to exploit the deathsquad's particular weakness to that type of damage. Also grab a welder if you can easily access one. Try and find people to ally with, one or two people watching your back infinitely increases your survival chances. Whether you can get these things or not, you must evacuate the station through any available means. Without some really strong leadership , the station is likely already devolving into a complete free-for-all , so crew are going to be stealing any docked shuttles fast. Try and get one for yourself. Most station maps give one to mining , engineering , and some give one to command. The other more risky choice is the emergency shuttle, It's very likely to become more of a trap than a viable method of escape. Deathsquad will quickly be swarming all over evac, shooting anyone that tries to get on board. If they aren't, then you should find a room to hide in nearby evac. For even further security, take your blowtorch and weld doors shut to slow hunting death squad down. They can destroy doors in half a dozen shots from their disruptor cannons, but that can give ample time to escape and find another hiding place. Also keep in mind that currently Deathsquad's night vision does not work, so take out the lights if you can. So, if all shuttles are taken and the emergency shuttle is destroyed or on its way, then you pretty much have one choice left; you've got to take the fight to them. To be honest, without a taser or other ranged stunning weapons, this is all but impossible. explosives deal no damage to death squad, and all it takes is for them to snap off a handful of shots and you will be dead from full health. So, play super Viet Cong guerilla-fighter style. Pop off one or two shots at them then flee like mad. rinse and repeat. Wear them down, and do NOT let them get access to healing supplies. Make them over-pursue and bleed out from their wounds. Use banana peels and space lube to slip them up as well. Maybe even steal their weapons while they are slipped on the ground. Set up traps along the way to the station nuke room or the nuke disk if they haven't taken it from the captain's stiff and cold hands. Do not forget that setting off the nuke is their goal, and if they succeed, then it's game over for everyone. Now, understand that even if you do prepare a hell of a defense, getting everything you could want from the armory and a team together to counter attack, or if you just hide in lockers in maintenance the whole time until you can make a mad dash for the emergency shuttle, you should know that there's an extremely high chance of dying. Often it will feel unfair, but that's Deathsquad for you. They are meant to cap off the peak craziness that can happen on unity station. So do what you can to survive, but make sure to have fun with it. And if by some chance you do survive, that's quite an achievement, so feel proud of yourself.

Access : Everything . Difficulty : Extreme . Note: ERT are not round-start roles and can only be accessed via events. The reasons for this should be clear by the end of the guide. ERT Overall \u00b6 So, the station is fucked, but not fucked enough to warrant a death squad ? Is someone in command simply incompetent? Has someone killed a Centcom Officer ? Well, its times like these that an ERT team may be sent, especially if one is requested using the communications console. The ERT officers are well armed and can adapt to fill a wide variety of roles, from fixing a reactor about to blow to spreading the word of the honk-mother. Know Your Power Rangers \u00b6 ERT come in the following types. Commanders, who lead ERT teams, Security, who act as guards, Medical, who act as doctors, Engineers, who act more like emergency repairmen, and a variety of joke roles. Almost all ERT officers are armed with an energy carbine (or tactical variant) and a stun baton and all of them are equipped with heavily armored ERT hardsuits. You should expect any ERT squad members to be at least competent in their assigned role. ERT Commander, Leading the A-team \u00b6 ERT commanders are the most barebones squad member, equipped with nothing but their carbine, 2 batons, and a set of handcuffs. Their job, as the name implies, is to lead the ERT team on whatever objective they are given by Centcom . To do this, they can make use of the unique Centcom channel to communicate plans, information, and orders to other members of the ERT team. If the chain of command is broken or the station is in anarchy , the commander of the response team may be forced to TEMPORARILY take charge in order to fill the power vacuum and allow a proper leader to be found peacefully. ERT Security, Diet Deathsquad \u00b6 The ERT security officer acts as the spearpoint of any ERT team. They are armed with a tactical energy carbine, baton, taser, and two pairs of handcuffs, and sport a red and black hardsuit. They are typically sent to apprehend security or heads of staff when the personnel onboard the station are unable or unwilling to do so. This typically is not a peaceful affair, and security ERT tend to kill more often then they apprehend, which is why they are often confused for being a death squad . ERT Medic, Walking Medkits \u00b6 The ERT medical officers are deployed to handle large scale medical emergencies, but sometimes are deployed not to save the crew, but to heal the ERT squad should they face especially heavy resistance. They wear a white marked hardsuit and are equipped with first aid kit and a medibelt. ERT Engineers, The Only Competent Engineers \u00b6 ERT engineers are only typically sent when something onboard the station has, or is about to, blow up horribly. Their job is to fix the damage to the station or prevent further damage, and in this they act more like emergency repairmen than engineers. They are the type of ERT that will most often split from the squad, simply because while the other ERT are sent to deal with people, the engineer is sent to deal with walls and reactors, both of which tend not to have legs. Along with the usual gun and baton, they come with a tool belt, industrial welding tool, and a first aid kit. Paranormal Response Team, Spanish Ghostbusters \u00b6 Technically a separate team, the PRT's purpose is to respond to and handle paranormal and cultish threats to the station. PRTs are similarly equipped to ERTs, apart from their custom magically fortified hardsuits, and come in 2 varieties; the inquisitor and the knight. Besides the armor, and the standard carbine, cuffs, and baton, the only unique item the inquisitor carries is the obsidian rod, just like the like the chaplain's . Joke ERT \u00b6 There are also two types of joke ERT: Janitor ERT, sent to purify and cleanse the station of filth and grime. The Janitor comes with an advanced mop, an empty bucket, a box of lightbulbs, stun baton, trash bag of holding, belt full of space cleaner spray bottles, back up mop, one'' wet floor sign and notably no energy carbine. Clown ERT, sent to bring joy and annoyance to the crew. The clown ERT does come with an energy carbine (ooph), as well as baton, cuffs, a bike horn, and a banana.

So, how do you stay alive? \u00b6 With so many people out for your life, you'd be glad to know that your office comes with your own special gun, called the Imperator, as well as a security belt and taser. You also start with the best general purpose armor on the station (though it only protects your chest) and a very durable hardsuit in your office (which protects your whole body while wearing it with the helmet, but slows you down a bunch). All of these things are good for shooting someone with and running away. That's right, running away. Unless you are very, very, robust, your best option when guys in red hardsuits or some greyshirt with a stetchkin attacks you is to run the hell away. That, or hiding in the armory behind walls of meatshields . Delegator Prime \u00b6 When you are not fighting off nukies and evading traitorous assistants , you are monitoring, managing, and inspecting. You have the ultimate veto power over all matters. There really is no way to tell you exactly how to run things, but here's some things you should keep in mind: 'Do not get involved, Delegate everything.' You should avoid doing any tasks that can be done by a subordinate. If there's a hull breach, do not fix it yourself. Get your CE to get off his ass and do it. 'Observe the Chain of Command.' You should spend the majority of the time commanding the department heads. Let them command their departments. Avoid skipping them in the decision-making process as they are the ones who should know their departments best. 'Do not tolerate excessive incompetence.' If a department head repeatedly demonstrates ineptitude at their job, or disrespects your authority, demote them from their position. If they don't comply, have them thrown in the brig and tried for mutiny. Keeping the crew overall happy \u00b6 Delegating and staying hidden can, however, trip you over more than it may help you in many situations, especially if your ordering executions and sec crackdowns often. To help with this, you can try to shed some anonymity through announcements declaring certain things legal and making areas public access. If you legalize drugs and open the gateway to prospecting adventurers, the crew will see you in a more positive light than if you commandeered your personal gestapo to kill any who opposed you. Secure Dat Fukken Disk \u00b6 The first thing you should do is get the fukken nuke disk and hide it on your person. Also take your spare ID. And probably your disk pinpointer, too. Guard the disk with you life. Do not show it to anyone. Do not trust it to anybody except maybe the Head of Security or Head of Personnel . If there is the barest hint of Syndicate activity on the station, drop whatever you are doing and book it to Security . The Syndies have their own disk pinpointers, and they can track the disk wherever it is. So if they are attacking the station, you need to squad up with the boys ASAP. Abandoning Ship \u00b6 As the way shifts in this game tend to go, at some point it might become necessary to abandon ship. This is done by going to your command console and summoning the Emergency Shuttle. The shuttle will arrive in a shorter amount of time the higher the station alert level is, so if the station is disintegrating from multiple meteor impacts or is actively being attacked, make sure to bump that alert level all the way to red. Don't forget though: You are ultimately responsible for the station. You should not be summoning the shuttle lightly. You should be doing your utmost to keep the station up and running. If the station has sustained damage, appraise its integrity to see if it's repairable first.

Colloquial name: \"HoP\" Overview \u00b6 The Head of Personnel, also commonly referred to as the HoP, is one of the command roles on the station, and arguably one of the most important jobs on the station, with the ability to change people's access levels using the terminal in their office, taking over for the captain when they inevitably get stabbed in the back, and keeping Ian the dog alive at all costs. Lawful Neutral \u00b6 The job of the HoP is relatively simple: sit in your office, change people's job or access levels if they ask for it for good reasons, and resist the urge to give yourself or other people all-access cards. On top of that, you're also the one making sure the Service roles are keeping the station running, and that Cargo isn't ordering in guns to help Cargonia become an independent station-state. However, your job can get slightly hectic; if the Captain is dead, or no one is playing as Captain, it's your job to take over their position until they are potentially cloned. Unless the person who killed them isn't smart, this is not a simple task. Crew Relations \u00b6 With your typically lighter workload compared to the other heads of staff, its a good idea to pay close attention to comms. It never hurts having a strong grasp of the what's going on around the station, and your job is to make sure Cargo is getting what the station needs, the janitor is cleaning floors, and the Cook and Botanist are delivering food. If you want to maintain a good relationship with the other heads, ask them over the command channel for their opinion before assigning someone to their department. You will be held accountable if you assign engineering an assistant that melts down the Reactor . Once you have become familiar with the post, you may have noticed that the Captain has a sweet ass pistol and all you get is a lame (but extremely robust) taser. It might be tempting to bump your clearance to all access and take a trip to the armory to get yourself something that has a bit more bite. It is recommended that you do not do this. The Captain is the ultimate authority on the station, and that comes with rights and privileges that others do not have, including you. The HoP cannot bear lethal weaponry unless given explicit permission by the Captain or the station is on either Blue alert or Red alert. That isn't to say that this limitation is not comprehensively enforced by Security, but do not be surprised if you get reported by the Warden for breaking and entering into the armory. Emergencies \u00b6 With you being second in command and the station being as dangerous as it is, you will often be the one who has to call the emergency shuttle when the Captain is occupied or dead. If they are still kicking, you should get permission from them first before calling the shuttle. If they aren't, then its your call whether an evacuation is necessary, with the same weight and responsibility the Captain bears with the decision. If the shuttle has been called DO NOT FORGET TO BRING IAN WITH YOU. Ian is a trained dog, so you can say, \"Ian follow!\" and Ian will follow behind you somewhat competently (doors give him a hard time). when you have him safe in the shuttle, you can say \"Ian stay!\" to make him stop.

If there's a hole in the station providing one of the hallways or departments with a fresh view of space, it's the Engineer's job to fix it. If wires have been cut and half the station is out of power, it's the Engineer's job to fix it. As an Engineer, people expect you to know at least the basics of Construction, how the power system works and how to lay wires, etc. If you're ever confused on what to do, ask the Chief Engineer . They should give you advice, since they are your superior and it's their job to coordinate and assist engineers. At the bare minimum, you must know how to fix a hull breach and how to turn on the SMES. Learn how to do these as an assistant to the CE before you play as the only engineer on a low population server. Otherwise, you will have a really angry station on your back. Bob the Builder \u00b6 this is just a very basic guide to how the construction system works. for a more in-depth guide, see Construction . In Unitystation, there are three materials you'll need to worry about: Metal Plates, Glass Sheets, and Metal Rods. There are some more, but these are the ones you'll most often be using. In order to craft/construct something, have a material selected in your hand, and either press Z or click on it in your hand. This will open a construction menu where you can select what item to build. Keep in mind some items will need more materials than others, for example a department battery will need 30 metal plates where as a girder will only need 2. Once you've clicked on the item you want to build, wait for the bar above your head to fill up, and boom, you've built the item you want to build. Another note is that some items in the construction menu are intermediary constructions that must be finished with additional construction. For example, to build a wall requires you to construct a metal girder with 2 metal sheets, then finish the wall by clicking on the girder with 2 more sheets. Construction materials will go very fast, especially with a full engineering department. It will likely be necessary to order more materials from Cargo . If you have a CE , get in touch with them about what you need. Their status as a head will get things ordered and shipped faster. However, the Shaft Miners might randomly show up with a humongous shipment of construction materials, both basic and exotic, to let you go nuts with. Be thankful you don't have to share them with Science yet. Electricity \u00b6 An Engineer's job is also to keep the station powered. At the beginning of the round, the station will have some power available in the SMESs, but it won't last long. It is your responsibility to start the engine. Different maps will have different engines for you to work with. The plasma generator is pretty typical and easy to set up. On some maps it will have to be taken out of storage, but you wrench it onto the high voltage power line that feeds into the transformer and then you power it on. In most stations, a crate of plasma will be available to you at round start, but the rest of engineering's stockpile is usually kept locked by shutters, unlockable only by the Chief Engineer. If someone complains about the lack of power despite the generator being fine, head to the area without power and make sure the wiring hasn't been cut. The alternative choices to powering the station are much more complicated, and can go horribly wrong if you don't manage things closely. It is highly recommended to not mess with them without having read the guides or having a more experienced engineer walk you through the steps. click here for the guide to starting the Singularity and Tesla Engines click here for the guide to starting the nuclear reactor Tools \u00b6 Engineers get given a set of tools, both in their toolbelt and in toolboxes stored around the department. These include: A Crowbar, for prying up floor tiles and prying open stuck doors and firelocks. A Screwdriver, for detaching windows, grilles, and dismantling unsecured girders. A Welder, for detaching the plates from walls and making repairs to damaged components. A Wrench, for securing and unsecuring items (such as vents, girders, plasma tanks [when in a shuttle's fuel slot], etc.) A Wirecutter, for cutting wires and destroying grilles A Multitool, used for connecting electrical machine to an APC and a variety of niche purposes.

The Ancient Engineer is first and foremost meant to serve as an opportunity for players to practice the basics of engineering and basic combat while they wait for the next round to start. When selected, you spawn as an Engineer who has been kept in suspended animation for an untold amount of time. You spawn with a decently robust but very heavy hardsuit and engineering equipment. Your station has fallen into disrepair in the extreme, with electrical and integrity issues everywhere. It is also inhabited by hostile creatures who will try to murder you on sight. If you are able to secure the station and repair enough of the systems damage, you will have basic suites to practice engineering, chemistry, atmospherics, and botany in relative peace. Your food, generator fuel, and building supplies are very limited, so you will have to develop a degree of self sufficiency if you want to stay. However, there are crates stashed away throughout the station that contain extra supplies if you are willing to search for them. The other choice is to repair the shuttle docked in the ship bay. To do so, you will have to find one of the two available shuttle console machine boards and use it to rebuild the piloting console in the shuttle. You will also have to secure plasma fuel from Atmospherics storage and dig away the asteroid rubble that has built up around the shuttle over the decades of inactivity.

Chemistry Basics \u00b6 You start with several items on you that are crucial to your success as a chemist. your goggles act just like that of the barkeep, and inform you of the reagents in any beaker you look at and the beakers strewn about your office are very much needed for holding liquids. to start, put one in a chem dispenser. The chem dispenser menu is where you'll spend most of your time as a chemist. The top bar controls how much of a substance you add when pressing a button, while the bottom bar allows you to remove chemicals from the beaker overall. Try mixing any old basic medical chem. The machine next to the dispenser is used for splitting up what you've created and deleting specific amounts of specific reagents. You can choose to get your chem out in the form of a bottle, patch, or pill, with some chems being best applied in certain methods. Experiment with meds and try to create a combination medicine that heals all damage types at once, the CMO will love you. Yeah, cool, when do i learn how to kill things? \u00b6 Much of the damage chemistry can cause comes in two forms, poisons, applied by whatever means you want, and explosives. Poisons can be manufactured in just the same way as medicines and applied in the same manner. Injecting someone you dislike with cyanide will work as a delivery mechanism, be it melee or from the barrel of a dart gun.

Advanced Chem \u00b6 Chemistry is easy to learn and hard to master. you can make a simple grenade with just water and potassium, but it wont come close to the maxcap breaking nitroglycerin grenades made by a charismatic and skilled chemist. To improve with chemistry, you should start with simple recepies, such as space lube and various medicines and simple toxins, and try your hand at intermediate ones like advanced medicines and basic narcotics. once you've got the hand of those, move on to explosives, poisons, and more advanced chems like meth. Once you feel like you have mastered making one trick ponies, you should move on to combining several medicines, poisons, or explosives to achieve greater effect, until you figure out how to unleash the fires of hell upon the station.

Their job is to heal injured people, bring back dead crew members, and provide the kitchen with dead bodies when other food sources run out. While it's not a required part of the role, it should be noted that non- antagonist Medical Doctors are generally expected to do no harm unless your own life or the life of an innocent is at stake; Your purpose is to preserve human life above all else.

Don't worry, ribs grow back! \u00b6 Let's get into the art of treatment and diagnosis. So the first thing you need to know is that all characters have 100 health, but health can go negative down to -100. While a character is above 0 health, they are conscious and functioning. Once they go below 0, they are in critical condition, only able to crawl around very slowly and talk quietly. At -100 they suffer a heart attack and die. So how do you heal hurt people? Well, Medics have access to first aid kits and burn treatment kits, which come with everything you need to treat all surface injuries. The first must-have-at-all-times is the health scanner. It's a tool that when used on a patient, tells you all accumulated damage broken down by type and by body part, allowing you to assess how to proceed with treatment. Damage types \u00b6 Brute damage is the most commonly seen type. It is from physical trauma, I.E. bullets to the chest and toolboxes to the head, as well as damage from low or high pressure environments, such as the vacuum of space. Brute damage is treated with bruise packs. These are found in first aid kits, the medical vending machine, as well as medibelts. You will typically run through quite a few of these, so refills will probably be necessary from time to time. Bruise packs heal 40 brute damage per use, but only will heal damage on the selected body part you apply it to. The second main source of damage is Burn damage. This is mostly caused from fires and energy weapons, such as E-guns, flamethrowers, and E-swords. It shows up, but not as frequently as brute damage. Burn damage is primarily treated with ointment. Each ointment use heals 40 burn damage. Toxin damage is another somewhat commonly encountered type. Toxin damage is gained through consuming toxins and poison, breathing in plasma gas, and by a few rare weapons, such as the energy crossbow. It is also accumulated from radiation poisoning. Toxin damage is slowly treated by the liver, so check to make sure your patient has one. It also can be treated with charcoal pills, so ask the chemist to craft some if needed. OxyLoss; The last commonly encountered damage type is oxygen loss , which is more of a symptom of other damage than it is its own damage type. It behaves exactly like any other damage, but is a result of the body not getting supplied with sufficient oxygen. This is both frequently caused by external factors or by internal health problems. If it's caused by a depressurization and atmospherics tampering, simply moving the patient to an environment with sufficient oxygen will do the trick. CPR can help improve the odds of their recover. However, you may encounter situations where crewmembers are suffering from OxyLoss with no immediate outside cause. This often implies organ damage either to the lungs or the heart. This may get improved over time, but it is possible for people to get locked into death spirals where their heart and lungs cannot sufficiently supply oxygen to the body which causes the organs to begin shutting down, eventually leading to cardiac arrest. To prevent this, surgical intervention will be required. Cellular damage; the first of the uncommon damage types that will be seen under specific circumstances. Cellular damage is currently only encountered when a person is cloned. Cellular damage has one treatment method, and that is proper nutrition and time. Organ damage; similar to OxyLoss, organ damage is not a traditional type of damage. Each organ has it's own health pool. The amount of health an organ has dictates how efficient the organ is, so an organ at 0 health is not functioning at all, while an organ at 75 health is functioning at 75% capacity. Organs in a particular body part take small amounts of damage whenever that body part takes damage and organs also take damage if they are not supplied oxygen by the circulatory system. When the heart is at 0 health, the body suffers a heart attack. When the brain is at 0 health, the body is brain dead. Tricks of the Trade \u00b6 CPR is done by clicking on the patient with an empty hand on help intent while they are adjacent to you. CPR takes 5 seconds to be performed, and while you are doing it, the patient stops taking OxyLoss. Once you have completed a round of CPR, the patient heals a small amount of OxyLoss. CPR is never a good solution to save someone's life. It only keeps them alive while you take them to the medbay to apply more advanced treatment. This is where help from other medical personnel or even passers-by can be indispensable. Having someone else performing CPR while you diagnose and treat will greatly increase the odds of survival for the patient, especially if there are multiple patients in critical condition. Surgery is initiate by having the patient lay down, taking the first surgical tool you need in hand, and then alt + click your patient on help intent. Imitation Meat \u00b6 So let's say you've applied what you know as a professional medical practitioner and your patient still died. Or maybe someone just found a cold stiffy shoved in a locker in maintenance. What do you do then? Well, you clone them, of course. Cloning is the ultimate mulligan. It can be done over and over as long as you've got a body to clone. When a character dies, take them to the cloning room and put them in the DNA scanner. This can be done by click-and-dragging their body into the DNA scanner while they are adjacent to it. once they are in and the scanner is shut, go to the cloning console and hit the scan button to create a DNA record. Once you've got their record, navigate to it and hit clone. So long as the player has not left the game, disabled cloning, and their body still has a brain in it, then it will start cloning their body. Cloning is really fast, only taking 10~15 seconds. Once they are cloned, make sure to pull their old body out of the scanner so they can re-equip their gear. When it comes to the intersection between cloning and role-playing; it is generally assumed that a clone does not know how exactly they died, or, if they were murdered, who did it. Their memory will be foggy and unclear, and they may have some confusion when it comes to understanding that they are a clone. Treat the circumstance of their death with a polite sensitivity. Note that the one critical flaw of the cloning process is that it requires a corpse in the first place; one that has not been too chewed up, as well. If the body is lost in space, lacks a brain, gibbed by explosions, butchered by the chef , or taken extensive enough fire damage as to be turned into a husk, then they cannot be scanned in the DNA scanner. One preventative measure that can be taken against this outcome is to scan high-risk people (or really any takers) in the DNA scanner in advance. The other problem is the aforementioned cellular damage inflicted by the cloning process. A fresh clone will be weak and need time to recover from the cloning process. Because of the cumulative effects, it is not a good idea to clone a person multiple times in quick succession. They will come out weaker and weaker until they cannot move and might die on the spot. Medical Modus Operandi \u00b6 Not sure what to do? Here's a handy set of operations that you can follow: 1) Heal critically injured crew members that are around medbay. They are the top priority. Dead people waiting to be cloned can wait a little longer. There is no heavy risk in doing this activity since people often have other priorities over killing you when they haven't died yet. 2) Clone dead people that were brought to you by the paramedics or another crew member. NEVER go find bodies on your own, as you might accidentally end up reviving a filthy antagonist that puts you into a box and throws you out an airlock. It also might not be a bad idea to ask Security if any dead to-be-clones that you get have any outstanding criminal charges. 3) Check on the prisoners in the brig and the security officers themselves. Security tends to be a hotspot for injuries, and its also an opportunity to flex on shitcurity for human rights abuse, maybe even inspiring them to change their ways . Lawyers will love you for this. 4) Open up the cloning bay for everyone to come get preemptively scanned just in case. Brings a whole new meaning to life insurance. 5) Typically, you will find that first aid kits are over-provisioned with burn ointment, and you should replace a stack with bruise packs or gauze. Burn treatment kits are also a thing, but they are mega overkill for most situations except mass-casualty burn incidents like station-wide plasma fires.

So the first thing you need to know is that all characters have 100 health, but health can go negative down to -100. While a character is above 0 health, they are conscious and functioning. Once they go below 0, they are in critical condition, only able to crawl around very slowly and talk quietly. At -100 they suffer a heart attack and die. So how do you heal hurt people? Well, Medics have access to first aid kits and burn treatment kits, which come with everything you need to treat all surface injuries. The first must-have-at-all-times is the health scanner.

Access levels: Security & cells , Maintenance, Difficulty: hard . Security are the Police force of the station, and often the second line of defense against the crew members turning the station into a battle royale (the first line being Janitors ). Often times, you have a simple job: Jail criminals, and make sure no one breaks into areas they shouldn't be in. You are a guardian between the ideals of justice and the wild psychotics that your company has chosen to advance its interests in space. Just because everyone else is insane, however, does not mean you are permitted to go hog-wild and beat them all unconscious to strap them to beds. Professionals have standards. DO NOT play Security if you're new to the game, it's a very easy way to find yourself surrounded by people wanting you dead for abusing your powers. It's also a very easy way to get job banned for not properly applying Space Law SECurity, not SHITcurity \u00b6 For some unknown reason, NanoTrasen has chosen to fill this top-notch research station with simple minded baboons who enjoy carnage. As a result, Security is mostly a necessity to keep crew members from destroying it. For the most part, this isn't too hard; you have a tazer, a stun baton (press Z while selected to activate stun mode, many have made that mistake before), and some handcuffs. 90% of the time, this is all you need, since someone with a crowbar on the other side of the room can't really do much when you can very easily taze them and then stun with your baton, then cuff them and take them to the cells. However, sometimes this isn't enough. Maybe Xenomorphs have invaded the station. They can't be stunned or cuffed, so your normal strategy won't really work. Not to worry, if the situation is getting out of hand, the Warden will hopefully allow you a lethal weapon from the armory. Just make sure the Assistants don't get their greasy, greytider hands on them, and you'll be fine; be very careful of people standing next to you when you are detaining them with weapons. Overall, just obey the orders of the HoS , keep assistants out of restricted areas, and arrest the shit out of any unwanted crew , and hopefully you're able to keep the station from turning into pure, unfiltered chaos. Know Your Place \u00b6 The station is ultimately not a military operation, but, as a member of Security, you follow the chain of command closer than any other crewmember: You take your orders from the HoS . You do not have to obey orders from the Warden unless they are acting-HoS. You also take orders from the Captain , and their orders superceed the HoS and anyone else except Central Command . You do not have to take orders from the HoP unless they are acting-Captain. You are expected to act according to Space Law during all of this. However, you must also develop a sense of when to apply Space Law and when to ignore it. If you arrest crewmembers for every little infraction, your career as a Security Officer will be a short lived one. You must also act according to Standard Operating Procedure. This defines when you are allowed to have weapons out or not, and when you are allowed to apply lethal force. Tips of the Trade \u00b6 Stun Batons have infinite charges. Tasers do not. Make sure you get your taser charged from time to time in the brig. If you are suspicious of any crewmembers, keep your distance. As an upholder of Space Law, you generally have to get probable cause before taking the initiative in a fight. This means that most of your fights will have you on your back foot. Your security armor let's you tank enough damage to probably be able to survive lethal attacks, but it does nothing to stop surprise banana slips, stun baton hits, weapon disarms, and other nasty tricks. If you sense a threat, keep at least 2 tiles between you and your target until you are ready to make a move. Handcuff people by applying handcuffs to them. A handcuffed person cannot move if they are grabbed by someone else. Strip people of their equipment by stunbatoning them and shift-clicking while adjacent to them. Do not put them in a prisoner's jumpsuit unless their stay in the brig is 10 minutes or longer. WATCH OUT FOR FLOOR LUBE. It's a very popular tactic to lube the tiles directly outside the security Department doors.

Equipment \u00b6 The Janitor's gear is highly specialized to cleaning messes: First is the galoshes. They prevent you from slipping on wet floors (even space lubed floors, but do not protect you from banana peels or bars of soap). Next is the janibelt. The janibelt is great because it starts with a mop, flashlight (equip to a pocket so it will shine at all times), a wet floor sign, and '4 space cleaner bottles.' The almightly space cleaner bottle. Space Cleaner is great because it does not leave a wet floor, so you can fire and forget. Not only that, but the bottle has a 3 tile range, allowing you to fire over counters and tables. Each bottle holds 100 space cleaner to begin with and consumes 6 per shot, so you get 17 per bottle. Once a bottle is empty, it can be refilled with water, but if there's a Chemist , they can manufacture more space cleaner for you. The less mighty, but still useful in a pinch bar of soap. Soap does not leave a wet floor either, and it has a lot more uses before running out than the space cleaner, but it is a lot slower to use. The mop-and-bucket combo is your main tool when the space cleaner runs out. The mop holds 25 units of fluid and consumes 5 units per use. You can clean multiple adjacent tiles at the same time. It can be refilled by dunking it in a bucket filled with water. Buckets hold 70 units of fluid and can be refilled at water tanks. Wet floor signs.
